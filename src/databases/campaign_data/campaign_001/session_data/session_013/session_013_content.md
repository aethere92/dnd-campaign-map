<p>At Diego’s hideout, the party took a much-needed long rest, knowing their next challenge would take them to the [ENTITY:class:Paladin] citadel. But their moment of peace shattered when a loud bang rang out across the horizon. Turning toward the harbor, they witnessed sheer destruction-a dragon emerged from the sea, demolishing a large wall lined with portals. As chaos unfolded, the Wicked Wench bombarded the harbor, ensuring no one escaped unscathed.</p>

<p>Amid the destruction, a strange moment of absurdity unfolded-a gong sounded, signaling what seemed like a weekend retreat for the Lizardmen, prompting them to cease their attacks for their well-earned break.</p>

<p>Determined to reach the citadel, the party moved toward the battering ram section of the wall. Along the way, they spotted a wooden fence, where a fallen [ENTITY:class:Paladin] lay motionless. The Ranger, moving stealthily, investigated and found two additional corpses, likely prisoners, along with several strange holes in the ground. Their search led them to six ore-filled carts and an unopened letter resting inside a shack.</p>

<p>The party launched their boldest plan yet-the [ENTITY:class:Sorcerer], Bard, and Ranger transformed into wargs, Mitzy sprinted ahead, the Barbarian consumed drugs, and the Cleric flew invisibly toward the citadel.</p>

<p>Despite a series of mishaps-including the Barbarian getting impaled on barbs and the Bard failing an intelligence check, mistaking squirrels for enemies-they eventually arrived and dispelled their transformations. At the citadel, they spoke with [ENTITY:class:Paladin] Garrond, who revealed that only eleven carts of ore had been mined.</p>

<p>Their investigations took them to the chapel, where they learned that one of their allies had been imprisoned for a ransom of 1000 gold. A deal was struck-the Fire Mage contributed 250, an idol/statue accounted for another 250, and the party pooled together the remaining 500 in gold and jewelry, securing their comrade’s freedom.</p>

<p>Seeking a route out of the citadel, they struck a deal with Dragon Hunters-warriors who had arrived after hearing of the dragon sighting. The riders agreed to help the party escape, offering two options: casting Fly on them or carrying them, with the latter proving more perilous.</p>

<p>With three Fly potions in hand, they enacted their plan: the [ENTITY:class:Sorcerer] used Dimension Door to teleport to Diego’s Hut, while the others turned invisible and flew toward their destination-their speed slowed slightly as the Ranger carried Mitzy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Fire Mage and Mercenary teleported toward the open sea, opting to swim to Korinis.</p>

<p>Near Diego’s hut, the party was ambushed by hooded figures-four mages, a rogue, and a barbarian. After a fierce battle, they stood victorious.</p>

<p>Back at Diego’s, they took shifts resting until Diego returned with trolls and a massive coffer. Upon opening, the coffer exploded, revealing 10 otter hides and gold, which Diego split among the party.</p>

<p>Their journey away from the Penal Colony seemed secure until they reached the [ENTITY:class:Paladin] checkpoint, only to discover its entrance had been destroyed and the guards slain. Contacting Lee, they secured reinforcements to help them flee while learning that the attackers were called Seekers-a formidable new threat.</p>

<p>Evading Seekers waiting at the crossroads, they detoured through the lake, barely reaching Erol’s house, where the Cleric struggled to keep up. After a quick discussion, they proceeded toward General Lee.</p>

<p>More Seekers awaited ahead, but their attention was elsewhere, giving the party an opportunity to maneuver past them unnoticed.</p>

<p>After a few brief encounters-including meeting Zero and Quixie for supplies-they arranged to meet Lee at the pyramids the next day, earning 2000 gold in gratitude for their aid.</p>

<p>Knowing they needed stealth, they turned invisible and headed toward the tavern to use the teleporter. Along the way, they called out to Diego, who agreed to join them via teleportation.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the pyramids, four Black Mercenary guards loomed near the teleporter. Choosing not to confront them, the party proceeded toward the next destination.</p>

<p>Back in the city, they split paths with Diego, who had business in the upper district.</p>

<p>Their first stop was Thorben, who immediately reprimanded the Ranger, branding them the worst apprentice he had ever trained. Despite the harsh words, the Ranger managed to purchase 40 precision arrows and 100 standard arrows.</p>

<p>At the merchant district, they restocked mana and healing potions, preparing for whatever lay ahead.</p>

<p>As they wandered the city, Diego reappeared-this time kicking out a traitor who had crossed him. Offering them a place to stay whenever needed, Diego reaffirmed his trust in them.</p>

<p>Finally, their session ended at Salamander’s, where they discovered he had been scammed by a pirate, closing yet another dramatic chapter in their adventure.</p>
