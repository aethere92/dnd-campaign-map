<p>The party returned to the inn, seeking both refuge and critical information. The bartender, a quiet follower of the Water Mages, provided insight into mercenary activity and handed them a key to teleporter B-a tool that could prove invaluable. Their next stop was Erol’s house, where further truths emerged regarding the tax quotas enforced by Silvestro, a prominent figure among the farmers.</p>

<p>Venturing beyond the city, they arrived at Silvestro’s estate, paying a steep 20 gold per person for safe passage. There, they engaged in swift trade with the eccentric Quixie and the ever-recognizable Jabba the Hutt, acquiring valuable items and a haste potion. Their travels also led them to a peculiar contest-a chocolate-eating competition at the inn. The Cleric and Barbarian triumphed, earning a hearty stew that permanently increased their max HP, while the rest of the party succumbed to nausea.</p>

<p>Their next encounter carried heavier stakes. General Lee shared his ambition to seize control of the city and revealed that the party had inadvertently exposed Captain Cunts to the ruthless Pirate Queen Bianca. Despite their blunder, Lee saw their potential and offered a deal-aid his lieutenants in exchange for the only safe route into the Valley of Mines, besieged by Lizardmen.</p>

<p>Further seeking expertise, the party trained under a Water Mage’s follower, honing their weapon skills before investigating the Blacksmith. An unsettling change had taken place-the city guards were different. Was this a sign of shifting power or mere duty rotation?</p>

<p>Driven by curiosity (or recklessness), they turned toward the Penal Colony. Before long, danger struck. Three orc mages ambushed them, wielding fire, ice, and lightning in a violent assault. The battle was brutal, but through sheer determination and tactical prowess, they overcame their foes.</p>

<p>Standing at yet another crossroads, heavier decisions loomed ahead. With rising tensions and greater mysteries unfolding, their journey was far from over.</p>
