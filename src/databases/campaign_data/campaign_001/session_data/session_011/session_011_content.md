<p>With the dust of their last adventure still settling, the party returned to the inn, seeking both respite and information. The bartender, a quiet but observant follower of the Water Mages, shared knowledge of mercenary movements and handed them a key to unlock teleporter B, an asset that could prove invaluable.</p>

<p>Their next destination was Erol’s house, where familiar conversation unraveled further truths. They learned about the guards and the tax quota imposed by Silvestro, an influential figure among the farmers.</p>

<p>As they moved beyond the city, the landscape stretched wide before them-a meadow teeming with cattle and sheep lay to the right, while expansive farmlands dominated the left. The decision was made: they turned toward the farm.</p>

<p>At Silvestro’s estate, the group paid the hefty 20 gold per person tax, ensuring safe passage within his domain. Their dealings soon led them to two merchants, the eccentric Quixie and the ever-recognizable Jabba the Hutt. The bartering was swift-gold exchanged hands, resulting in the acquisition of a haste potion and two valuable items totaling around 1000 gold.</p>

<p>Among the strange happenings of the land, one stood out-the inn to the left announced a competition: whoever could consume the most chocolate would be crowned the victor. Temptation proved too strong to resist. The party dove in, stomachs ready for war.</p>

<p>The Cleric and Barbarian stood triumphant, their endurance rewarded with a stew that permanently increased their max HP by 5. The others? Not so lucky, as nausea overcame them, leaving their failure in rather... graphic detail.</p>

<p>The next encounter was less jovial-General Lee, a man with a bold plan. He confided in them his ambitions to flee the island and take control of the city. However, in an unfortunate twist, the party may have accidentally doomed Captain Cunts, revealing his location to the ruthless Pirate Queen Bianca. Lee, understanding their blunder, still saw value in them and proposed a deal-help his lieutenants, and he would reveal the only safe passage into the Valley of Mines, currently besieged by Lizardmen.</p>

<p>Still seeking knowledge, they met with another follower of the Water Mages, a hardened trainer drilling mercenary recruits. A training session followed, sharpening their expertise in chosen weapons-an advantage they would soon need.</p>

<p>A brief detour led them to the Blacksmith, where they delved into the intricacies of metalwork and weapon forging. Yet, something felt different-the guards had changed since their first visit. A shifting power? Or simply a rearrangement of duty?</p>

<p>Curiosity (or recklessness) guided their path left-toward the Penal Colony. What could possibly go wrong?</p>

<p>At the edge of the road, two paladins stood watch, their presence reinforcing the seriousness of the frontier. To their right, a ruined tower, a remnant of forgotten battles; to their left, sprawling farmland, its golden fields contrasting the danger that loomed ahead.</p>

<p>Before they could react, ambush struck. Their passive perception failed, leaving them vulnerable to three orc mages-each wielding a mastery over fire, ice, and lightning. The battle raged in violent bursts of magic and steel, their foes relentless. Yet, through sheer determination and tactical prowess, the party emerged victorious, the orcs falling before them.</p>

<p>As the dust settled, they stood at yet another crossroads. Their choices grew heavier, their path darker. What awaited them beyond this? Only the next chapter would reveal.</p>
