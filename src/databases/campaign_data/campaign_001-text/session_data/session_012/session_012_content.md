<p>The adventurers' journey took another turbulent turn as they pieced together fragments of mysterious happenings across the land. Starting with two mercenaries, they uncovered troubling news—two more mages were active nearby, and worse yet, a farmer had been killed by one of them. Uncertainty hung in the air.</p>

<p>Seeking rest, they returned to the inn, where General Lee revealed yet another unsettling truth—they weren’t the only ones attacked recently. Sensing deeper conspiracy, the party sought a direct audience with Lee.</p>

<p>Their investigation led them to Oviedo’s farm, where a large figure loomed in the shadows. Confronting Silvestro and another unknown individual, the party pressed for answers. The two men denied the rumors of being werewolves, claiming instead that potions had enhanced their size unnaturally. Whether truth or deception, it was difficult to tell.</p>

<p>After waking General Lee, the group relayed critical intel about Bianca’s betrayal and the pyramid’s location, cementing their role as key players in the unfolding conflict.</p>

<p>Their next destination? The Penal Colony.</p>

<p>At its entrance, two [ENTITY:class:Paladin] guards stood firm, granting them two keys that allowed safe passage inside the colony. Following Lee’s advice, they took a shortcut—but danger lurked.</p>

<p>Midway through the dark cavern, spiders swarmed them, launching a chaotic ambush. The fight was desperate, their escape only barely successful, forcing them to retreat before the creatures could overwhelm them.</p>

<p>Emerging into the open, they found themselves before abandoned mines, intuitively recognizing them as Lee’s recommended path forward. Pressing on, they reached the mine exit, stepping onto a high ledge. Below, the [ENTITY:class:Paladin] citadel stretched across the horizon, its mighty walls promising refuge.</p>

<p>With careful planning and precision, they secured ropes to the cave wall, descending safely from the precarious ridge without incident. Climbing up a nearby ladder, they stumbled upon two merchants—a penguin named Zero and a drugged rabbit called Quickse. Bartering ensued, items were purchased, and exhausted from their trials, the adventurers took a long rest, allowing their stamina and health to recover.</p>

<p>But peace was fleeting.</p>

<p>Without warning, they were ambushed—dinosaurs, primal and relentless, crashed through the terrain, nearly wiping them out. Their survival teetered on a knife’s edge.</p>

<p>Then, Diego arrived—and with him, the truth of his nature. A werewolf in the flesh. Yet instead of hostility, he spoke—listening to the adventurers, he decided to bring them to his hideout.</p>

<p>After their grueling ordeal, they finally reached Diego’s refuge, concluding yet another volatile chapter in their growing legend.</p>
