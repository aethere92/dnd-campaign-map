<p>After resting at Diego’s hideout, the party prepared for their next challenge—the [ENTITY:class:Paladin] citadel. Their respite was shattered by chaos at the harbor, where a dragon emerged from the sea, demolishing a wall lined with portals. Amidst the destruction, the Wicked Wench bombarded the docks, ensuring no escape.</p>

<p>As the party moved toward the citadel, they encountered fallen Paladins, ore carts, and an unopened letter. Their boldest plan yet unfolded—transformations, invisibility, and sheer determination carried them forward. Despite mishaps, they reached the citadel and learned that only eleven carts of ore had been mined.</p>

<p>In the chapel, they discovered an imprisoned ally, negotiating a costly ransom to secure their comrade’s freedom. To escape the citadel, they struck a deal with Dragon Hunters, using Fly spells and teleportation to evade threats. Meanwhile, others swam to Korinis.</p>

<p>Near Diego’s hut, an ambush awaited—four mages, a rogue, and a barbarian. The battle was fierce, but the party triumphed. Returning to Diego, they witnessed a coffer explosion, earning gold and otter hides in the aftermath.</p>

<p>Their journey back to the city was fraught with danger. The [ENTITY:class:Paladin] checkpoint was destroyed, its guards slain, and a new threat emerged—the Seekers. Navigating past them, the adventurers regrouped with General Lee, securing reinforcements. Evading more Seekers at the crossroads, they detoured through a lake, narrowly reaching Erol’s house.</p>

<p>A brief return to the merchant district allowed them to replenish supplies. Diego reappeared, solidifying his trust in the group. Their session ended at Salamander’s, where they uncovered a pirate scam, concluding yet another dramatic chapter in their adventure.</p>
