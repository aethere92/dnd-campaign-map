<p>With the memory of their previous expedition still fresh, the party once again ventured beyond the city walls, stepping onto the winding paths of the forest they had first glimpsed upon arriving. The towering trees loomed overhead, their branches twisting like gnarled fingers, casting long shadows across the earthy trail.</p>

<p>As they moved deeper, the quiet hum of nature was interrupted by distant sounds-wolves prowling nearby and the murmur of voices from a goblin camp. Unwilling to tempt fate with either foe, they opted for a secluded path, their movements silent and calculated, blending into the underbrush like wraiths.</p>

<p>Through the mist-veiled distance, a Lizardman came into view. The party’s Cleric, ever hopeful, sent forth a spell, attempting to bridge the divide with peaceful magic-a gesture of diplomacy, a chance to talk. But the spell was met with rage rather than understanding. With a snarl of fury, the Lizardman lunged, and battle erupted amidst the tangled roots and shifting light.</p>

<p>The clash was brutal, each strike and spell tearing into the thick of combat. Then, before the dust could settle, the goblin horde struck-a chaotic wave of shrieking warriors descending upon the battlefield. The Lizardman fell beneath their blades, slain by the same goblins who had watched from the shadows. Outnumbered but unrelenting, the party fought through the chaos, and in the end, stood victorious.</p>

<p>Their triumph was short-lived. Before they could catch their breath, bandits emerged from the underbrush, their cloaks heavy with smuggled goods. The party saw the signs-these weren’t mere highwaymen. They were smugglers, likely ferrying stolen wares into the city. But there were too many, the odds stacked against them, and after a tense moment of consideration, the adventurers made the wise choice to retreat. Fleeing through the winding paths, they evaded their pursuers, vanishing into the depths of the forest.</p>

<p>To avoid further encounters with the creatures they had glimpsed earlier, they carefully shifted their route, finding another path that led them away from danger.</p>

<p>As they re-entered the city gates, the familiar sight of stone and structure brought an odd comfort. Their first destination was the [ENTITY:class:Paladin] Guard, where they relayed everything-the bandits, the smuggled goods, their location. The paladin listened intently, his face darkening with concern. Something was brewing within the city’s underbelly, and their report only strengthened the growing suspicion.</p>

<p>With exhaustion gnawing at them, the party made their way to the inn, where they sought rest once more, their minds clouded with the events of the day and the threats still lurking beyond the city walls.</p>
