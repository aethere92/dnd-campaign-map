<p>Determined to continue their journey, the party once again left the safety of the city walls, stepping onto the familiar forest trails. Towering trees and tangled roots surrounded them, their path shrouded in mist and thick shadows. The distant growls of prowling wolves and murmurs from a goblin camp urged them to take a cautious detour, moving like wraiths through the underbrush.</p>

<p>Spotting a lone Lizardman, their Cleric attempted diplomacy, sending forth peaceful magic. But the effort was met with fury, and battle erupted. The fight was fierce, and before the dust settled, a goblin horde swarmed in, cutting down the Lizardman before turning on the party. Outnumbered but unyielding, the adventurers fought through the chaos, emerging victorious.</p>

<p>Their triumph was short-lived. Bandits—smugglers laden with stolen goods—appeared from the shadows. The odds were stacked against them, and after weighing their chances, they fled into the depths of the forest, narrowly escaping their pursuers.</p>

<p>Navigating away from further danger, they eventually found their way back to the city. Their first stop was the [ENTITY:class:Paladin] Guard, where they revealed the troubling presence of smugglers. The paladin’s grim expression confirmed their suspicions—something dark was stirring within the city’s underbelly.</p>

<p>With exhaustion taking hold, the adventurers retreated to the inn, their minds heavy with the day’s trials. Though the city’s walls surrounded them, they knew the dangers lurking beyond had not yet been fully uncovered.</p>
