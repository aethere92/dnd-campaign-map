<p>The party’s adventure took a dramatic turn as they rode atop the turtle, uncovering new secrets about the mysterious Wizard and Druid guiding their journey.</p>

<p>Their path led them into a barren wasteland, where broken trees and decrepit land stretched endlessly. The river cut through the desolate terrain, with forests looming on either side. Above them, an awe-inspiring sight—a floating pyramid suspended 300 meters in the air, its structure cascading with waterfalls. Below, chaos unfurled—undead rising from the earth, clashing against Lizardmen warriors.</p>

<p>Utilizing their stealth, they reached the island beneath the pyramid, where a portal stood, revealing a vast castle beyond.</p>

<p>Stepping into the portal, they found themselves in Castle Drakenhopf’s antechamber, where Berrican welcomed them and confirmed that the others had already arrived—all of whom were vampires. The undead hosts offered to store their belongings in their rooms, setting the tone for their stay.</p>

<p>Before them lay an expansive ballroom, with grand staircases and corridors stretching in different directions. As they delved deeper, they uncovered the true nature of the ritual—every 1000 years, the ruling vampire families gathered, and only one house would awaken, while the other three were forced into a deep slumber.</p>

<p>Presented with a choice—rest or engage with the houses—the adventurers opted for diplomacy, seeking an audience with the four great families.</p>

<p>House Von K (Purple)</p>

<p>Their first stop led them to Vlad and Isabella, who outlined the importance of secrecy and manipulation, warning that direct influence over votes had previously resulted in catastrophic family feuds. Their house specialized in espionage and subtle control, preferring to operate from the shadows.</p>

<p>House Blood of Neferata (Blue)</p>

<p>Next, they entered a desert-themed chamber, meeting Arwa, the unsettling leader of this faction. Their boon granted +4 to the worst save and removed somatic spell components. Their agenda was clear—preserving the purity of their desert lands (which, apparently, involved wiping out everyone else).</p>

<p>House Oleg (Green)</p>

<p>In the Viking-styled room, shields, weapons, and a roaring fire set the tone. Here, they reunited with Lee, Diego, and Cord, confirming their safety. Oleg, seated upon his throne of stone, offered powerful regenerative and resistance boons. His house favored direct combat and war, their reputation marked by historical rivalries.</p>

<p>House Blood Dragons (Red)</p>

<p>Finally, they entered a jousting field adorned with royal banners. Their leader, Osprick, sought to reclaim his ancestral home, and their boon granted Red Fury—lowered crit threshold (18), and triggered rage upon critical hits.</p>

<p>Returning to the main chamber, they prepared for one last meeting—a mysterious warrior wielding a map. Inside the training room, Grimgore Ironhide battled a frost dragon, nearly perishing under its deadly frost blast. Observing the battle from above, the party witnessed his crushing victory, earning his respect.</p>

<p>The night culminated in the grand vampire ball, where roles shifted unexpectedly:</p>

<p>- The Barbarian attended the Strigoi party, learning that joining a house granted additional perks.</p>

<p>- The Cleric took to the dance floor, the Bard orchestrated the music, and the Ranger and Cleric eavesdropped, discovering that the warriors present significantly favored the Blood Dragons—making their victory all but inevitable.</p>

<p>At midnight, the votes were cast, and the castle trembled—a ritual had begun earlier than expected.</p>

<p>When the decision was finalized, the Blood Dragons emerged victorious, their leaders sacrificing themselves to activate the ritual. Four great pillars surged with energy, revealing a descending staircase.</p>

<p>Each faction—commoners, wizards, Lee’s men, Finley’s murlocs, and Grimgore’s orcs—were sent in different directions, marking the beginning of an ancient trial.</p>

<p>Descending into the Grand Canyon-like landscape, the party spotted dog-like creatures in pursuit of something, their chase leading into a temple beyond the rock walls. Behind them, a massive forest loomed, its treacherous cliffs hinting at dangers yet unseen.</p>

<p>As battle erupted, they fought fiercely, barely surviving the encounter—only to realize their journey was far from over.</p>
