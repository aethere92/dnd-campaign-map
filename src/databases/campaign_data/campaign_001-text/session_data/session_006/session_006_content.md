<p>As dawn broke, the party stirred from their slumber, the chill of morning clinging to them. Their mission was clear—venture into the woods and gather the elusive herbs requested by the alchemist. Packing their gear, they set forth, the towering city walls soon shrinking behind them.</p>

<p>Just as they reached the gates, city guards halted them, their piercing gazes scanning the party. "Heading into the forest?" one asked, his tone measured. Upon hearing their intentions, the guards exchanged glances before nodding. "Good luck—you’ll need it," one muttered as the adventurers stepped beyond the safety of the city.</p>

<p>The winding forest path beckoned them forward, its canopy thick with leaves that filtered sunlight into scattered patches across the ground. The air was rich with the scent of damp earth and pine, the distant sounds of wildlife creating a symphony of nature. Their trek was peaceful—for a time.</p>

<p>Then, the peace shattered. A pack of wolves, their amber eyes gleaming hungrily, emerged from the underbrush. Snarls filled the air as the beasts lunged. Blades flashed, magic sparked, and the battle was a chaotic flurry of movement. The fight tested their resilience, but when the dust settled, the party stood victorious. Blood stained the ground, the lifeless forms of their foes sprawled across the forest floor. They salvaged the hides, knowing their worth in securing an apprenticeship—a reward for their brutal struggle.</p>

<p>Pressing on, they stumbled upon caves nestled within the rocky terrain. The moment they entered, an unsettling sight greeted them—pools of blue blood, a telltale mark of lizardmen. Their unease grew as they spotted terrifying creatures lurking in the shadows—beings far beyond their capabilities to face. Silent, careful, they withdrew before they could attract attention.</p>

<p>Further along the road, near an old bridge, they encountered a battered man—Erol. His face was twisted in pain, his leg broken from a recent encounter with bandits. Without hesitation, the party’s Cleric knelt beside him, weaving a spell of healing. The magic worked swiftly, and relief flooded Erol’s face as he tested his newly mended leg. Grateful, he shared his woes—bandits had stripped him of everything.</p>

<p>Nearby, the presence of Isgaroth, a Fire Mage, caught their attention. He stood in solemn prayer, his aura crackling with arcane energy. Rather than interrupt, the party waited two hours in quiet patience. When his chant finally ceased, he turned to them and, impressed by their journey to the Monastery, bestowed a Fire Mage’s blessing upon them—free of charge.</p>

<p>With night creeping upon them, they sought shelter at the inn at the crossroads. The inviting warmth of the tavern promised comfort, but their coin purses were light—the prices proved far too steep. Weary, they made the difficult choice to return to the city, seeking refuge where their dwindling funds could secure a place to rest.</p>

<p>Thus, another chapter of their journey closed, with the wilds testing their courage and the city awaiting their next move.</p>
