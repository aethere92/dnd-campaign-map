						text: "The session began at Diego's cabin, where the party took a well-earned long rest to prepare for their journey to the Paladin Citadel. Their respite was shattered by a loud bang from the harbor. Looking out, they saw a massive dragon bursting through a sea wall riddled with portals, followed by the Wicked Wench bombarding the harbor. Amidst the chaos, the party noticed some lizardfolk retreating after a gong sounded—their weekend tradition kept them from further fighting.",

						text: 'Setting out for the citadel, the group took the route leading to the battering ram section of the wall. Along the way, they spotted a wooden fence with a fallen paladin nearby. The ranger stealthily approached and discovered the scene: a dead paladin, two deceased prisoners, and several ominous holes in the ground. Six carts filled with ore and a letter in a nearby shack hinted at something darker.',

					{
						text: 'Deciding to press on, the party devised a bold plan: the sorcerer, bard, and ranger transformed into wargs for speed; Mitzy sprinted ahead; the barbarian consumed a concoction of drugs for a boost; and the cleric flew invisibly to scout from above. The cleric reached the citadel first, alerting the guards to their arrival—and casually discussing soup recipes. Meanwhile, the barbarian and the wargs struggled to traverse the terrain. The barbarian was impaled on barbs, and the bard (in warg form) failed an intelligence check, chasing squirrels before finally reuniting with the group at the citadel.',

						text: "While two members visited the chapel to speak with a fire mage, the others conversed with newly arrived dragon riders—elite hunters who had heard rumors of a dragon in the area. The riders agreed to help the party escape the citadel, either by carrying them or casting Fly. At the chapel, the fire mage revealed that one of Diego's comrades, Gorn, was imprisoned with a ransom of 1,000 gold. Pooling their resources, they gathered 250 gold from the mage, contributed an idol worth 250, and scrounged up the remaining 500 in gold and jewelry.",

The bard and sorcerer would use Dimension Door to teleport to Diego's hut, while the others sought aid from the dragon riders. The riders provided three Fly potions, and the sorcerer cast Invisibility on the flying party members. Meanwhile, the fire mage and mercenary teleported to the open sea, swimming toward Korinis.",

Diego generously split the gold with the party. Resolving to leave the Penal Colony, the party retraced their steps to the paladin checkpoint. There, they found the entrance destroyed and the guards slain. General Lee, contacted via magical means, revealed that the attackers were creatures called 'seekers'.
