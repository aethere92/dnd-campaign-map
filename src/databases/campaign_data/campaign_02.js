			<p>The story of our five heroes begins, as many do, on a road leading toward a town.</p>
			<p>But this is no well-traveled path of cobblestones and dust - instead, it winds through a thick tangle of knee-high weeds and scattered trees, draped in the vibrant green of a subtropical forest. The air is heavy with the scent of life and growth, and the sound of distant creatures echoes beneath the canopy.</p>
			<p>Our heroes are quite the unlikely bunch - a rare mix of races and origins - but they travel together in good spirits, friendly and merry, sharing tales and learning more of one another with each step.</p>
			<p>They have met before, here and there. Once or twice as allies, perhaps once or twice as obstacles to each other's paths. Yet none of that seems to matter now. Whatever reasons brought them together - whether shared cause or secret ambition - they move forward as one, at least for now.</p>

			<p>Now, one by one, let us see who they are.</p>

			<p><h3><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Olek">Olek</span>, the Aasimar Paladin of Helm</h3></p>

			<p>He is devotion given form - an angelic soul clad in armor, kind and just, friendly and ever ready for conversation. <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Olek">Olek</span> is honorable to his very core, though humble in his ways, never one to boast or seek glory.</p>

			<p>His story is unlike any other. As a child, he and his sibling were raised not by kin of their own kind, but by wolves, deep within the forest. How they came to be there, he cannot say. The memory is lost to time or fate. But the pack was family, and he knew love in fur and fang.</p>

			<p>Then came the day of fire and chaos - a savage raid by orcs, goblins, and fouler things still. In the desperate struggle, his pack urged the siblings to flee. In the confusion, they were separated. <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Olek">Olek</span> wandered for days beneath the trees, searching for his family, for his brother or sister, for anyone.</p>

			<p>And then, when all hope seemed lost, fate intervened. A celestial being descended - radiant and awe-inspiring, not Helm himself but a servant of his will, a divine entity bound closely to the God of Guardians. With a voice like distant thunder wrapped in warmth, the being offered <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Olek">Olek</span> a pact, with one charge:</p>

			<p>Help as many as you can. Save those in need. Whatever you may do, walk forward with the teachings of our Father. Never stray. Never falter.</p>

			<p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Olek">Olek</span> accepted.</p>

			<p>He reached the town of Bryndol, where he offered help wherever it was needed. He stood beside other paladins of Helm, worked to defend the weak, and forged both likely and unlikely bonds. And now, he finds himself walking beside four others, toward the distant town of Drellin's Ferry, with justice and goodness lighting his path.</p>

			<p>Whatever awaits them there, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Olek">Olek</span> walks forward with purpose - for the lost, for the helpless, for the ideals he now embodies.</p>

			<p><h3><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span>, the Sorcerer with Dragon's Blood</h3></p>

			<p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span>, like so many other gifted children born into this world, did not have an easy start in life. Born into a poor family, with a father who enjoyed his drink a bit too much, and a mother unable to defend herself or her daughter, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span> learned early to keep quiet and keep to herself.</p>

			<p>She was beautiful, even as a child, and a strange, mysterious energy seemed to surround her. Drawing attention was never ideal - especially not in a household like hers. Her parents, frightened and unsure of what she was becoming, kept her gifts hidden from the world.</p>

			<p>As fate often does, it intervened on a stormy, rain-soaked night. While searching for shelter from the downpour, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span> stumbled upon a terrible scene: a fair Lady, beset by bandits. <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span> panicked, frozen in fear, uncertain of how to help. But then, in a flash of lightning everything shifted.</p>

			<p>The lady was never truly in danger. Magic poured out of her in powerful waves, and the bandits stood no chance.</p>

			<p>Awestruck, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span> stepped closer, throwing caution to the wind. There was something familiar between them - something felt rather than seen. They were alike, somehow. They both knew it.</p>

			<p>The lady introduced herself as Zella, and she listened - truly listened - to <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span>'s story. Her struggles, her fears, the confusion that had shadowed her life. And then Zella made an offer: to take <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span> under her wing and teach her the ways of magic.</p>

			<p>It was a painful decision. To leave her family and everything she had known behind, or to remain and live forever as only half of herself. But the excitement - the longing to understand what she was - overwhelmed her doubt. She went with Zella.</p>

			<p>They spent years together. Zella taught her everything she knew, drilled every bit of magical knowledge into <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span>'s mind. When there was nothing left to teach, she sent her student onward - to Luskan, to find the Arcane Brotherhood. A place of boundless learning, where the magically gifted could find their path. A place, perhaps, to belong.</p>

			<p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span> joined the Brotherhood but soon discovered that great institutions often hide terrible secrets. Together with a friend she made within its walls, she uncovered one such secret - a map leading to a great treasure. And together, they fled. The road led them to Bryndol.</p>

			<p>And so, we find <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span> now, her secrets held tight behind guarded eyes, the stolen map close to her heart. Beside her walks her dearest companion, and three strange allies whose paths are now twined with hers. Together they journey to Drellin's Ferry.</p>

			<p>The future, like magic, is uncertain. But <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span> walks forward - beautiful, dangerous, and full of lightning.</p>

			<p><h3><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Soshi">Soshi</span>, the Eladrin Wizard from the Feywilds</h3></p>

			<p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Soshi">Soshi</span> was not born in the world of mortals. As all fey creatures do, she was born in the Feywilds - magic giving her shape and form, infusing her with the changing seasons.</p>

			<p>By now, we know that fate plays a hand in the lives of all beings. Some say she wandered too close to a thin place in the weave, others whisper she was drawn through by the echoes of something calling her. Whatever the cause, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Soshi">Soshi</span> crossed into the Material Plane as a child, stepping through unseen doors and emerging into the harsh, unforgiving port city of Luskan.</p>

			<p>Alone, alien, and stripped of the familiar cadence of fey life, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Soshi">Soshi</span> learned quickly that her joyful magic and dreamlike presence were of little use in this place. Life among mortals was different - here, power was survival, and magic was currency.</p>

			<p>Slowly, desire crawled through the cracks left by doubt and a wavering sense of self. Slowly, it made her forget what she was, where she came from, and what magic was supposed to be.</p>

			<p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Soshi">Soshi</span> buried herself in books. Arcane formulas, incantations, the elegant structure of wizardry - she consumed it all with the desperation of someone who had everything to</p>

			<p>prove. In time, her dedication was noticed. The Arcane Brotherhood, ever in search of useful minds, extended a hand. Desperate to belong, desperate to be powerful, she took it.</p>

			<p>But by now, we also know the Brotherhood isn't a place of fairytales. Its dark, twisted secrets came to light, terrifying <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Soshi">Soshi</span> - reminding her that some prices are too high to pay.</p>

			<p>And so, together with the only friend she managed to make in this unforgiving world, she stole a map - a way for them to survive in the wide, dangerous world beyond.</p>

			<p>Driven by regrets, desires, and ambition, longing for home and the joyful life she left behind, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Soshi">Soshi</span> finds herself traveling with four other companions: her friend from the Brotherhood, and three others as different as night is from day.</p>

			<p>And so, we find <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Soshi">Soshi</span>, her spellbook in hand and memories of the Feywild stirring in her chest, walking the winding road to Drellin's Ferry.</p>

			<p><h3><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span>, the Earth Genasi Echo Knight of the Shifting Fates</h3></p>

			<p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> was an unusual child in a very usual family. Born out of humans, in a small mining village blessed by a Dao genie, he lived a simple life. Clever, full of energy, and with trouble always finding him, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> enjoyed his days, finding excitement in what others would consider mundane.</p>

			<p>He became fast friends with Thalos, the son of a deeply religious Earth Genasi family. They couldn't have been more different - <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> scoffed at tradition, finding it impractical, while Thalos honored it in every word, every piece of clothing, every step. But their souls were alike, and together they spent their days chasing adventure, uncovering secrets, and exploring hidden tunnels.</p>

			<p>As we've become accustomed, fate decided to meddle once more. During their daily search for excitement, they discovered a new tunnel. Of course, giddy and chatty and bickering, they delved in with no caution taken, no trap detected - because what could go wrong in such a simple village?</p>

			<p>Thalos stepped onto a pressure plate.</p>

			<p>That's all it took to shatter <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span>'s life. That's all it took for him to lose his friend - for him to almost lose himself.</p>

			<p>Thalos was nowhere to be found. Assumed dead by the village, with only his traditional garb left behind.</p>

			<p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> never gave up. He looked for him. He was sure his friend had been taken somewhere.</p>

			<p>As time passed, strange things started happening to <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span>. Terrible visions would show themselves to him, accompanied by excruciating headaches. He could see himself living a thousand lives, fighting a hundred battles, speaking tongues he had never heard before. He understood - whatever took his friend gave him visions of his alternate lives.</p>

			<p>But through it all, he knew - whatever had taken Thalos had left something in him. A connection. A thread.</p>

			<p>And where there is a thread, there is a trail.</p>

			<p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> left his village, left his life behind. He looked for answers in the only place he could think of - the shadowy tunnels where exiles lived. Among them, he found one that would speak with him: a wizened mage by the name of Verenn Yorr. Verenn found that he could help <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> master his new abilities, trained him in combat while teaching him how to harness his visions and use them to his own will.</p>

			<p>When all teachings were done, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> adventured into the world. He joined a company of soldiers, learned what he could from them. But he never forgot. His friend was still out there, waiting to be found.</p>

			<p>In memory of Thalos, no matter what he wore, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> always donned the traditional garb over. This way he would never forget. This way he would never stop looking.</p>

			<p>And now we find <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> on the road to Drellin's Ferry, walking beside four unlikely companions. He keeps his past close and his mission closer - his eyes on the path ahead, and his soul reaching for the one left behind.</p>

			<p><h3><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Bonnie">Bonnie</span>, the pixie rogue full of mischief</h3></p>

			<p>Here we are - our fifth hero. So far, we've heard tales of lost families, fractured selves, and friends long gone - of longings for magic, regrets for what once was, and hopes for what could be. <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Bonnie">Bonnie</span>, however, is not like that.</p>

			<p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Bonnie">Bonnie</span> is a fairy pixie born from the pure magic of the Feywilds. She had no real family - other fairies born like her could be considered one, but she never saw it that way. She had no home beyond trees and groves, caves and lakes. <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Bonnie">Bonnie</span> lived her long life doing whatever she pleased, always with her trusted companion, friend, and what she would call family: Jacques, the antlered giant rat.</p>

			<p>Pixies are known to be a little mischievous, but rarely with a truly mean bone in them. <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Bonnie">Bonnie</span>, however, seems to have that particular trait in spades. She found joy in rule-breaking, in taking what wasn't hers. She enjoyed doing what she wanted, when she wanted, and nothing - absolutely nothing - could stand in her way.</p>

			<p>But ah, what <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Bonnie">Bonnie</span> did not anticipate was that fate had plans for her, too. One lovely morning, while dodging a swarm of angry Summer Court Sprites, she ran headfirst into someone who had no business being this deep in the Feywilds - a Quickling by the name of Clyde. Now, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Bonnie">Bonnie</span> didn't care for rules, and instead of reporting the trespasser, she befriended him.</p>

			<p>In time, the two caused a storm of chaos together. They broke rules, borrowed (as they called it) treasures, stirred up trouble wherever they went. Their lives were fast and bright, a whirlwind of trouble and laughter - until the consequences finally caught up.</p>

			<p>Clyde was captured by the Sprites and dragged before Queen Titania herself. A spy, they claimed. Sent by the twisted Winter Queen. The sentence was swift: execution.</p>

			<p>What <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Bonnie">Bonnie</span> never expected in her long, chaotic life was to care for someone other than Jacques. But she did. So, she stepped forward, confessed to everything in a desperate attempt to save her friend.</p>

			<p>Clyde was spared. <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Bonnie">Bonnie</span> was not. Exiled to the mortal plane, cut off from the Feywilds, with no way back. Clyde was gone. Magic was... different now.</p>

			<p>But <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Bonnie">Bonnie</span> was scrappy. She carved out a life in Bryndol, adapted to the strange new shape of her magic, and stayed close to Jacques - even if he was quite a bit smaller now than he once was. She spent her time with the Thieves' Guild, either waiting for something better to come along or searching for a way back home.</p>

			<p>And maybe, just maybe, that something finally did.</p>

			<p>On an errand to reach Drellin's Ferry, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Bonnie">Bonnie</span> finds herself traveling with four odd companions, and while she brings trouble and pranks to their lives, she also watches their backs in her own special way.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Here we are at last, on the way to Drellin's Ferry with a crew of misfits - five people, all chasing something that might fulfill their hopes and dreams, or simply trying to stop the world from unraveling.</p>

			<p>Now that we're all caught up with our heroes' stories, let's see what happened on the road to Drellin's Ferry!</p>
        `,
		recap: `<p>Five strangers walk a path less traveled—through tangled weeds and whispering trees—toward the town of Drellin’s Ferry. Though their footsteps fall in unison now, each of them carries a life shaped by fate, tragedy, and a desire for something more. They are unlikely allies, bound together by choice or chance, but united in purpose... for now.</p>

		<p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Olek">Olek</span>, a Paladin of Helm, walks with the calm strength of one touched by the divine. Raised by wolves, orphaned by war, and uplifted by a celestial being, his journey is one of service and steadfast honor. With a heart full of duty and a past veiled in fire, he brings light to the dark places they travel.</p>

		<p>Beside him walks <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span>, a sorcerer touched by dragon’s blood and haunted by a stolen map. Fleeing the shadows of the Arcane Brotherhood with her closest companion, she guards her secrets with sharp wit and quiet strength. Her friend, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Soshi">Soshi</span>—a Feyborn wizard who traded whimsy for power—shares in that escape, both burdened by the Brotherhood’s darkness and driven by dreams of belonging.</p>

		<p>Then there’s <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span>, the echo-walking genasi who seeks a friend lost to a trap and a mystery buried in time. Haunted by visions of other lives and trained to wield them as weapons, he wears tradition on his sleeve and carries the past on his back, each step a search for answers that lie beyond the veil of fate.</p>

		<p>And finally, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Bonnie">Bonnie</span>—a trickster pixie exiled from the Feywild for loving too deeply and breaking too many rules. With Jacques the rat at her side and chaos in her wake, she hides a loyal heart beneath layers of mischief. Together, these five travel toward Drellin’s Ferry, carrying hope, grief, ambition, and mischief in equal measure. What awaits them on the road is still unwritten.</p>`,

	KAEDIN: {
		background: `<p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> was born in the mining village of Grackledorn, carved into the rugged ridges of the Earthspur Mountains near the edge of the Great Rift. The land there thrummed with old power, remnants of a time when a mighty Dao genie once struck a pact with the mountain dwarves, leaving the region steeped in latent elemental magic. Though his parents were human, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span>'s body and soul were forever marked by this place—born of stone and thunder, forged in silence and shifting earth. </p>

        <p>As a child, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> was clever, energetic, and always on the verge of mischief. His constant partner in trouble was Thalos, the son of stoic, deeply religious Earth Genasi parents who upheld every tradition with unwavering reverence. Thalos always wore his people's ceremonial robes, stiff with cultural pride and stitched with sacred patterns of stone. <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> mocked them at first—he found them impractical, absurd for cave diving and running through the hills. But Thalos never cared what <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> thought; he wore them because they meant something.</p>

        <p>One fateful day, at only ten years old, the two friends ventured into a newly revealed tunnel in the cliffs beyond the village. The air inside was sharp with arcane charge, and the walls glittered with strange, glowing crystal veins. In the heart of that cave, they found an ancient monolith—a beacon of pure energy, covered in glowing symbols <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> would one day recognize as belonging to the Kryn Dynasty.</p>

        <p>Their laughter and arguing masked the danger until it was too late. A pressure plate clicked beneath Thalos's foot, and the beacon flared to life. Dunamis energy surged through the cavern, and before <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> could act, Thalos was consumed by the pulse—his form collapsing into a shimmer of light before vanishing entirely. Only his robes remained, crumpled on the stone floor. The village assumed Thalos had been lost in a cave-in. But <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> knew the truth: something had taken his friend beyond the boundaries of their world. </p>
        
        <p>In the months that followed, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> began to experience disturbing visions. He would seize up with piercing headaches, and during those moments, the world seemed to warp—reflections of himself flickered across the edges of his sight, and time stuttered like a skipped breath. He saw himself fighting battles he hadn't lived, speaking words he'd never learned. He was seeing alternate versions of his life—echoes.</p>

        <p>Desperate for answers, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> eventually traveled east, following rumors of Kryn exiles who had continued their study of dunamancy in secret. In the shadowy tunnels beneath Velkynvelve, he found them—arcane researchers, deserters, and mystics. One of them, a wizened mage named Verenn Yorr, recognized the potential in <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span>'s unstable visions and offered to help.
        Under Verenn's guidance, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> learned to harness the rifts within himself. He trained to stabilize the echoes and turn them into extensions of his will—shadows of himself pulled from other timelines, weapons shaped from the possibilities of his own existence. With discipline and will, he became something new: an Echo Knight, a warrior with one foot planted in every version of reality.
        <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> joined a soldier's company not long after, hoping to gain the discipline and experience to master his strange powers. But he never stopped searching. He wore Thalos's traditional Earth Genasi robes over his armor, adapting them to his style: long black cloaks with golden trims, chainmail hidden beneath flowing earthen fabric. The other soldiers mocked his appearance, seeing only a mystic trying to play at being a knight. That laughter quickly died on the training grounds.
        <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> never tried to correct their assumptions. He remained quiet, direct, and solitary. Many mistook his reserved nature for a lack of charisma, but <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> had long since abandoned social rituals. Every word, every action, was weighed for purpose. He did not fight for glory or gold—he fought to control the powers of fate, to learn how to step through time itself, and to find the one timeline where Thalos still lived.</p>

        <p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> had been tracing reports of arcane disturbances—instances where individuals claimed to have seen visions of themselves acting out moments that hadn't yet occurred. Whispers of these strange anomalies led him west, to the Elsir Vale, a land scattered with ruins of ancient civilizations and known for its thin veil between worlds. Rumors in Dennovar spoke of a ruined fortress to the north where the walls shimmered at night and shadows moved without a source.</p>

        <p>He arrived in Brindol, the Vale's largest city, under the guise of a wandering soldier-scholar, seeking tomes and local accounts of planar rifts. His presence, though quiet, didn't go unnoticed for long.</p>

        <p>When goblin raids intensified, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> stepped in to defend a merchant caravan during a sudden ambush. His command of echo magic—blinking in and out of reality, fighting alongside his own shadows—left survivors stunned. Word of the strange warrior reached Lord Jarmaath of Brindol, who was desperate for capable allies as tensions in the region worsened.</p>

        <p>Their agreement was simple: <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> would scout the threat in the wilds surrounding Brindol, confirm the reports of a united goblinoid force, identify the warlord behind it, and uncover what their endgame was.</p>

        <p>But for <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span>, there was more to it than a mission. He had heard rumors that the warlord, used strange tactics—ambushes that unfolded like they had foreseen their enemies' every move. It could have been coincidence. Or it could be another sign of dunamancy at work.</p>`,
		shortDescription: `<span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span>, an Echo Knight born near the Great Rift, was marked by ancient elemental magic despite his human lineage. After losing his childhood friend Thalos to a mysterious dunamis beacon, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> began experiencing visions of alternate selves. His search for answers led him to secret Kryn mystics, where he learned to control his echoes. Now a stoic, battle-hardened warrior draped in Thalos's Genasi robes, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Kaedin">Kaedin</span> travels the Elsir Vale, hunting signs of temporal magic—hoping to master fate and find the timeline where his friend still lives.`,

		<p>His story is unlike any other. As a child, he and his sibling were raised not by kin of their own kind, but by wolves, deep within the forest. How they came to be there, he cannot say. The memory is lost to time or fate. But the pack was family, and he knew love in fur and fang.</p>

		<p>Then came the day of fire and chaos - a savage raid by orcs, goblins, and fouler things still. In the desperate struggle, his pack urged the siblings to flee. In the confusion, they were separated. <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Olek">Olek</span> wandered for days beneath the trees, searching for his family, for his brother or sister, for anyone.</p>

		<p>And then, when all hope seemed lost, fate intervened. A celestial being descended - radiant and awe-inspiring, not Helm himself but a servant of his will, a divine entity bound closely to the God of Guardians. With a voice like distant thunder wrapped in warmth, the being offered <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Olek">Olek</span> a pact, with one charge:</p>

		<p>Help as many as you can. Save those in need. Whatever you may do, walk forward with the teachings of our Father. Never stray. Never falter.</p>

		<p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Olek">Olek</span> accepted.</p>

		<p>He reached the town of Bryndol, where he offered help wherever it was needed. He stood beside other paladins of Helm, worked to defend the weak, and forged both likely and unlikely bonds. And now, he finds himself walking beside four others, toward the distant town of Drellin's Ferry, with justice and goodness lighting his path.</p>

		<p>Whatever awaits them there, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Olek">Olek</span> walks forward with purpose - for the lost, for the helpless, for the ideals he now embodies.</p>`,

		background: `<p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Soshi">Soshi</span> was not born in the world of mortals. As all fey creatures do, she was born in the Feywilds - magic giving her shape and form, infusing her with the changing seasons.</p>

		<p>By now, we know that fate plays a hand in the lives of all beings. Some say she wandered too close to a thin place in the weave, others whisper she was drawn through by the echoes of something calling her. Whatever the cause, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Soshi">Soshi</span> crossed into the Material Plane as a child, stepping through unseen doors and emerging into the harsh, unforgiving port city of Luskan.</p>

		<p>Alone, alien, and stripped of the familiar cadence of fey life, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Soshi">Soshi</span> learned quickly that her joyful magic and dreamlike presence were of little use in this place. Life among mortals was different - here, power was survival, and magic was currency.</p>

		<p>Slowly, desire crawled through the cracks left by doubt and a wavering sense of self. Slowly, it made her forget what she was, where she came from, and what magic was supposed to be.</p>

		<p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Soshi">Soshi</span> buried herself in books. Arcane formulas, incantations, the elegant structure of wizardry - she consumed it all with the desperation of someone who had everything to</p>

		<p>prove. In time, her dedication was noticed. The Arcane Brotherhood, ever in search of useful minds, extended a hand. Desperate to belong, desperate to be powerful, she took it.</p>

		<p>But by now, we also know the Brotherhood isn’t a place of fairytales. Its dark, twisted secrets came to light, terrifying <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Soshi">Soshi</span> - reminding her that some prices are too high to pay.</p>

		<p>And so, together with the only friend she managed to make in this unforgiving world, she stole a map - a way for them to survive in the wide, dangerous world beyond.</p>

		<p>Driven by regrets, desires, and ambition, longing for home and the joyful life she left behind, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Soshi">Soshi</span> finds herself traveling with four other companions: her friend from the Brotherhood, and three others as different as night is from day.</p>

		<p>And so, we find <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Soshi">Soshi</span>, her spellbook in hand and memories of the Feywild stirring in her chest, walking the winding road to Drellin's Ferry.</p>`,

	NORR: {
		background: `<p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span>, like so many other gifted children born into this world, did not have an easy start in life. Born into a poor family, with a father who enjoyed his drink a bit too much, and a mother unable to defend herself or her daughter, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span> learned early to keep quiet and keep to herself.</p>

		<p>She was beautiful, even as a child, and a strange, mysterious energy seemed to surround her. Drawing attention was never ideal - especially not in a household like hers. Her parents, frightened and unsure of what she was becoming, kept her gifts hidden from the world.</p>

		<p>As fate often does, it intervened on a stormy, rain-soaked night. While searching for shelter from the downpour, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span> stumbled upon a terrible scene: a fair Lady, beset by bandits. <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span> panicked, frozen in fear, uncertain of how to help. But then, in a flash of lightning everything shifted.</p>

		<p>The lady was never truly in danger. Magic poured out of her in powerful waves, and the bandits stood no chance.</p>

		<p>Awestruck, <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span> stepped closer, throwing caution to the wind. There was something familiar between them - something felt rather than seen. They were alike, somehow. They both knew it.</p>

		<p>The lady introduced herself as Zella, and she listened - truly listened - to <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span>’s story. Her struggles, her fears, the confusion that had shadowed her life. And then Zella made an offer: to take <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span> under her wing and teach her the ways of magic.</p>

		<p>It was a painful decision. To leave her family and everything she had known behind, or to remain and live forever as only half of herself. But the excitement - the longing to understand what she was - overwhelmed her doubt. She went with Zella.</p>

		<p>They spent years together. Zella taught her everything she knew, drilled every bit of magical knowledge into <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span>’s mind. When there was nothing left to teach, she sent her student onward - to Luskan, to find the Arcane Brotherhood. A place of boundless learning, where the magically gifted could find their path. A place, perhaps, to belong.</p>

		<p><span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span> joined the Brotherhood but soon discovered that great institutions often hide terrible secrets. Together with a friend she made within its walls, she uncovered one such secret - a map leading to a great treasure. And together, they fled. The road led them to Bryndol.</p>

		<p>And so, we find <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span> now, her secrets held tight behind guarded eyes, the stolen map close to her heart. Beside her walks her dearest companion, and three strange allies whose paths are now twined with hers. Together they journey to Drellin's Ferry.</p>

		<p>The future, like magic, is uncertain. But <span class="character-highlight" data-character="Norr">Norr</span> walks forward - beautiful, dangerous, and full of lightning.</p>`,
