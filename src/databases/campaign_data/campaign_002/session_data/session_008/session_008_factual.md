<p><strong>Regrouping and Recovery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party regrouped after the previous battle in the fortress courtyard.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] was heavily injured (5 HP remaining), prompting discussion about using remaining healing resources.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Norr] and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] reviewed their limited spell slots; the group debated whether to take a short rest.</li>
<li>They decided against resting to avoid losing momentum and potential surprise.</li>
<li>The group moved to a more defensible position to patch wounds and plan.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie]&rsquo;s familiar returned with a pack of fish &ldquo;gift,&rdquo; prompting lighthearted banter before refocusing on the mission.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scouting the Fortress</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] scouted the perimeter (Investigation 21), discovering:</li>
<ul>
<li>The main gate heavily fortified and locked.</li>
<li>Two other entry points: through the burned barracks (right) and a side door into an administrative building with visible guards.</li>
</ul>
<li>She recommended the barracks route as the least defended.</li>
<li>Time check: roughly 6 PM, daylight fading.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] used hit dice to recover to 49 HP.</li>
<li>The group clarified familiar durations and prepared for infiltration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Noisy Infiltration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] led the stealth approach; heavy armor made silence difficult.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin]&rsquo;s armor produced constant noise (&ldquo;clink-clank&rdquo;), and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] tore her cloak during movement.</li>
<li>Despite decent rolls ([ENTITY:character:Kaedin] 15), the group was audibly detected.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] advanced alone to scout interior rooms:</li>
<ul>
<li>Found an empty throne room with torture devices and several dead merchants.</li>
<li>Recovered a roughly sketched tactical map she couldn&rsquo;t interpret.</li>
</ul>
<li>As the party followed, their noise echoed through the halls&mdash;[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] remarked that &ldquo;the entire fortress probably heard them coming.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The group reassembled in the main hall, weapons ready to proceed deeper.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discovery and Debate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party descended into lower tunnels via a sloping ramp.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] searched for traps while others analyzed discovered maps and documents.</li>
<li>Findings included:</li>
<ul>
<li>Evidence of a large enemy force marching toward <strong>Drellin&rsquo;s Ferry</strong>, ETA &asymp; 4 days.</li>
<li>Estimated enemy strength &asymp; 19 &times; greater than previous engagements.</li>
<li>A single bridge en route&mdash;potential choke point to delay the invasion 2&ndash;3 days if destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<li>Debate followed:</li>
<ul>
<li>Some argued to warn or save the village; others felt the townsfolk had ignored prior warnings and should face consequences.</li>
<li>Messaging options via familiars were dismissed due to range limits.</li>
</ul>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] identified signs of a <strong>red dragon&rsquo;s</strong> involvement (magical residue and claw marks), confirming dragon activity tied to the invasion.</li>
<li>The discovery heightened urgency and internal disagreement on next steps.</li>
<li>Two paths revealed ahead:</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Left:</strong> bloody tracks, whispers, scent of the aerial creature, and fresh air.</li>
<li><strong>Right:</strong> quieter, descending deeper into the structure.</li>
</ul>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Norr] and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] sensed strong arcane energies from the left passage.</li>
<li>The group opted to investigate cautiously.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Ritual Chamber</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jack the familiar was sent ahead to scout while the group explored the right corridor.</li>
<li>They reached a circular stone chamber with:</li>
<ul>
<li>Faded runes, blood-stained ritual circle, and scattered corpses (mercenaries and rogues).</li>
<li>Signs of a suspended <strong>blood-binding ritual</strong> designed to open a sealed stone door.</li>
</ul>
<li>Among the dead was <strong>Kalistra</strong>, the group&rsquo;s former mentor, confirming her death during the ritual.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie]&rsquo;s Thieves&rsquo; Cant revealed markings linking both the <strong>Arcane Seekers</strong> and the <strong>Brotherhood</strong> to this operation.</li>
<li>Heated discussion followed:</li>
<ul>
<li>Some party members had hidden knowledge of a map leading here.</li>
<li>Accusations of deception and withheld motives surfaced.</li>
<li>The group concluded the sealed chamber likely held something powerful and dangerous.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Blood Magic and Spectral Guardians</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The party decided to complete the ritual to open the sealed door.</li>
<li>One member performed the blood draw (Constitution save), another channeled energy (Charisma check).</li>
<li>As the ritual activated, the corpses animated&mdash;<strong>spectral guardians</strong> rose to attack.</li>
<li>Combat highlights:</li>
<ul>
<li>Ghostly attacks drained <strong>memories</strong> instead of only HP.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Soshi] and others lost fragments of traumatic memories.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Olek]&rsquo;s divine powers temporarily failed, severing his holy connection.</li>
<li>The wolf familiar was nearly drawn into the ritual&rsquo;s energy.</li>
</ul>
<li>Tactical coordination and damage mitigation became critical; the group balanced survival with maintaining the ritual.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Soshi] debated using excess power from the bound souls; [ENTITY:character:Olek] questioned the morality of that act, reinforcing her &ldquo;good&rdquo; alignment.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Norr] maintained focus under extreme pressure, channeling energy while allies fended off ghosts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Door Shatters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Norr]&rsquo;s ritual beam intensified into a green-electric arc toward the sealed door.</li>
<li>All her spell slots refreshed, but HP dropped to 33.</li>
<li>Massive combined attacks followed:</li>
<ul>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] landed critical dagger strikes (34 damage).</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] delivered a critical blow with 13 damage, then used a potion (14 healing).</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Soshi]&rsquo;s <strong>Scorching Ray</strong> added consistent ranged damage.</li>
</ul>
<li>The ghosts concentrated attacks on [ENTITY:character:Norr], dealing 34 damage and dropping her to 0 HP.</li>
<li>The ritual&rsquo;s magic sustained her body, allowing [ENTITY:character:Olek] to stabilize her with a potion</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Norr]&rsquo;s spirit briefly separated, then was pulled back into her body.</li>
<li>With a final 23 Charisma check, [ENTITY:character:Norr] completed the ritual&mdash;<strong>the door shattered</strong>, the beam dissipated, and the ghosts&rsquo; link was broken.</li>
<li>Consequences:</li>
<ul>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Norr] &ndash; Intelligence &ndash;2.</li>
<li>Gained +2 3rd-level and +2 2nd-level spell slots permanently.</li>
<li>Alignment shifted to <strong>Neutral</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Temple Battle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The newly opened chamber triggered a massive fight inside the corrupted temple.</li>
<li>Enemy casters and warriors surrounded the party.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin]&rsquo;s <strong>Green-Flame Blade</strong> chain-hit multiple targets (24 damage + 11 follow-up).</li>
<li>An enemy wall of fire dropped [ENTITY:character:Norr] again (19 fire damage).</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] landed another critical hit (20 damage) during an opportunity attack, saving [ENTITY:character:Norr] from being executed.</li>
<li>The support caster ([ENTITY:character:Soshi]) used a modified <strong>Aganazar&rsquo;s Scorcher</strong> as a healing conduit, restoring:</li>
<ul>
<li>22 HP to [ENTITY:character:Norr].</li>
<li>Additional healing to [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] and [ENTITY:character:Olek].</li>
</ul>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Norr] retaliated with <strong>Dragon&rsquo;s Breath &ndash; Lightning</strong> (Dex DC 18 failures; 22 damage, two enemies killed).</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Olek] landed a <strong>critical smite</strong> (34 damage), finishing the final caster.</li>
<li>The party stood victorious but exhausted; multiple members had fallen unconscious during the fight.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Vault and the Null Brand</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Investigation 27 revealed key artifacts and items:</li>
<ul>
<li>Patch of strange mushrooms.</li>
<li>Bone flute.</li>
<li>Book titled <em>The Deama Sutrel.</em></li>
<li>Strength Belt (STR 18) and Amulet of Absorption.</li>
</ul>
<li>Loot distributed after debate on item suitability.</li>
<li>Proceeding deeper, they discovered the <strong>final vault</strong>&mdash;a blackstone chamber radiating corruption.</li>
<li>At its center: a <strong>black iron brand</strong> shaped like a broken star, glowing with red runes&mdash;the <strong>Null Brand</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Kalistra</strong>, still alive but aged and corrupted, was bound to it by arcane chains, using her life to contain the artifact&rsquo;s energy.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] approached unseen (Stealth Nat 20), recovered magical boots, and assessed the scene.</li>
<li>Tense dialogue with Kalistra followed; she requested aid to stabilize the Brand, hinting at plans to later claim it for the Brotherhood.</li>
<li>The group planned contingencies to restrain or neutralize her after the ritual (Hold Person, Counterspell, Grapple).</li>
<li>Before they could act, a <strong>red dragonkin</strong> and <strong>20 orcs</strong> arrived outside the vault.</li>
<li>The dragon&rsquo;s command echoed through the chamber:<br /> &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve breached the chamber for us! Go in and take the artifact!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Session ended with the party trapped between Kalistra and the incoming dragon-led force.</li>
</ul>
