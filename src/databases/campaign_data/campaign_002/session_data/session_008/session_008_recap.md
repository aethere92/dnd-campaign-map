<p>The party regrouped after a brutal fight, with [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] using his hit dice to recover substantial health. They decided against a full short rest, wary of their enemies regrouping. While recovering, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] scouted the fortress, finding the main gate locked but identifying two other entrances: the burned-out barracks and a side entrance to an administrative building.</p>

<p>Opting for stealth through the barracks, their attempt at silent entry was undermined by the heavily armored [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]'s "clink clank" and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] snagging her cloak with an audible rip. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] went ahead, mapping an abandoned throne room that showed signs of recent violence and the remains of merchants. She found a roughly scribbled map but was more interested in threats and escape routes. The party's noisy approach, especially [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]'s echoing armor, made subtlety impossible.</p>

<p>Descending into a tunnel system, the party discovered a map detailing a major enemy force—thirty units—gathering to strike [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry] in four days. A military-trained member assessed this force as nineteen times stronger than what they’d previously faced. They identified a crucial vulnerability: destroying a bridge one day away could delay the attack by two to three days. This intel led to a debate on whether to risk sabotage or simply warn the stubbornly remaining villagers. Further investigation by [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] revealed the unmistakable magical signature of a red dragon in the area.</p>

<p>Following another passage, they entered a circular stone chamber marked by a large, dried-blood-stained ritual circle. It was a dangerous blood binding ritual designed to open a sealed stone door. Among the half-dozen corpses, a party member recognized their former teacher, Kalistra, who had apparently sacrificed herself. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] discovered markings indicating the involvement of both the Arcane Seekers and the Brotherhood.</p>

<p>The party performed the ritual to open the door, but activating the powerful magic awakened the souls of the dead mercenaries, which rose as wraith-like spectral entities. The ghosts' attacks didn't just wound the body, they tore away the party members' traumatic memories. [ENTITY:character:Soshi] stood at the center, debating whether a good-aligned character should draw more energy from the tortured souls than was necessary to open the door.</p>

<p>Amid the combat, [ENTITY:character:Norr] committed to maintaining the magical channel for the ritual. A surge of green, electrical energy erupted, striking [ENTITY:character:Norr] and channeling into the stone door, causing it to crack. Though the power instantly refreshed all of [ENTITY:character:Norr]'s spell slots, she was critically injured and briefly became a ghostly visage when she collapsed. With a final, powerful check, [ENTITY:character:Norr] shattered the door. The traumatic experience came with a price: [ENTITY:character:Norr]'s Intelligence was reduced by two points, but her alignment shifted to Neutral, and she gained permanent additional spell slots.</p>

<p>Entering the temple, the party was immediately embroiled in a fierce battle. The timely, unconventional healing of a support caster revived [ENTITY:character:Norr], who had again fallen unconscious from a wall of fire. [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] and [ENTITY:character:Olek] delivered devastating critical hits against enemy casters, with [ENTITY:character:Olek]'s divine smite ending a major threat.</p>

<p>Continuing their exploration, they found a blackstone vault. On a pedestal rested the artifact they sought: the Null Brand, a black iron brand of terrible power that corrupted the land. Kalistra, their former teacher from the [ENTITY:guild:Arcane Brotherhood], was there, one hand fused to the cursed object and using her life force to contain its influence. As the party debated helping Kalistra purify the artifact while planning to prevent her escape, a wall of twenty armored orcs and a booming red dragon appeared, commanded to take the Brand. The chamber became a sudden, chaotic battlefield, with the fate of the cursed artifact hanging in the balance.</p>
