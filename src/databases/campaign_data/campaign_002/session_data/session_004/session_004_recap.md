<p>The previous session ended back in [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry]. The party returned to the Tollhouse in the town and spoke with [ENTITY:npc:Soranna], who led them to the basement for a private conversation. [ENTITY:npc:Soranna] was informed about the attacks and marked them on a map. She rewarded the party with 10 gold pieces and mentioned that she had leads into the hordes thanks to two skilled individuals under her command: [ENTITY:npc:Kat], a thiefling with a passion for cats, and [ENTITY:npc:Yoghurt], a lactose intolerant half-ogre assassin. These individuals were previously part of the [ENTITY:guild:Thieves Guild] and had been cast away from the city.</p>

<p>The party then returned to the [ENTITY:location:Green Apple Inn], where they cleaned up and discovered that [ENTITY:character:Soshi] had two hydra eggs. They learned that the eggs could hatch at any moment due to the right temperature conditions. After cleaning up, they heard about [ENTITY:npc:Anya], a missing assistant at the inn. The party decided to investigate [ENTITY:npc:Anya]’s house, where they found blood and an unfinished letter indicating she was pregnant. They questioned the townsfolk and learned about [ENTITY:npc:Anya]’s frequent visitors.</p>

<p>Back at the inn, the party met the [ENTITY:guild:Winter Rose] mercenaries, who shared their experiences with Giant Raptors and Thylacoleos. The mercenaries revealed that the raptors were scared of fire and strong light. The party then learned about Lem, a town guard who had been attacked and was recovering at the barracks.</p>

<p>The next morning, the party met [ENTITY:npc:Kat] and [ENTITY:npc:Yoghurt], who wanted to rob the Wizard. They learned more about the cave system under the city, which led to the Temple and was blocked by a barrier of light. The party decided to explore the caves, leaving the hydra eggs with [ENTITY:npc:Avarthel], a druid, who refused to hatch them due to their uncontrollable nature.</p>

<p>In the caves, the party encountered various creatures and traps. They bypassed a pond with a sleeping giant creature and reached a large room with electronic gadgets and remains of creatures. They fought a reptile, which [ENTITY:character:Soshi] cleverly polymorphed into a caterpillar. The party found valuable items and pressed a rune to open a door, avoiding a potential skeleton uprising.</p>

<p>The session ended with the party entering a new corridor, ready for the next adventure.</p>
