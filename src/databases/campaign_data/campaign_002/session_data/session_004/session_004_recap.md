<p>After returning to [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry], the party met with [ENTITY:npc:Soranna] at the Tollhouse. Concerned about disturbing the townsfolk with their filthy state, she led them into the basement, where they shared what they’d seen: corpses mauled in the woods, green-cloaked figures, and a missing woodsman. [ENTITY:npc:Soranna], unfamiliar with hydras, added a red-flagged pin to a growing map of attacks. She rewarded the group with ten gold and revealed troubling news: a vast cave system lies beneath the city, potentially a secret invasion route. Two of her agents would meet them in the morning - [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] recognized them as [ENTITY:npc:Kat] and [ENTITY:npc:Yoghurt], misfits cast out of the Thieves' Guild.</p>

<p>After returning to the [ENTITY:location:Green Apple Inn], the party cleaned up - where [ENTITY:character:Soshi] discovered two hydra eggs in her pack. The warmth and humidity threatened to hatch them. Meanwhile, they learned from a barmaid that a young girl named [ENTITY:npc:Anya] had gone missing. Following clues to her home, the group found dried blood, a love letter to a guard named [ENTITY:npc:Lem], and suspicious townsfolk watching from the shadows. The town gossip revealed that [ENTITY:npc:Anya] had been romantically involved with many men until about six months ago.</p>

<p>Later, they met with the returning [ENTITY:guild:Winter Rose] mercenaries - [ENTITY:npc:Vandal] and [ENTITY:npc:Summoner] - who had barely escaped an ambush in the eastern woods. Giant raptors and thylacoleos had attacked them, but fire kept the beasts at bay. The raptors bore the mark of shackles, hinting at another hobgoblin clan. Tharma, the innkeeper, handed [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] a romance novel and revealed [ENTITY:npc:Lem] had been injured and was recovering at the barracks.</p>

<p>The next morning, [ENTITY:npc:Kat] and [ENTITY:npc:Yoghurt] arrived. [ENTITY:npc:Kat], a nondescript Tiefling with globes of cats and a tiger around his waist, and [ENTITY:npc:Yoghurt], a lactose-intolerant half-ogre in a kimono, shared what they’d learned: the tunnel beneath the town led to an old temple, blocked by a magical barrier that rejected city affiliates. Only outsiders - like the party - could pass. The wizard claimed it was cursed. [ENTITY:npc:Kat] also asked for gold to repay debts. No one obliged.</p>

<p>The party traveled to [ENTITY:npc:Avarthel], the druid, who was mid-wedding. He led them to his grove near the [ENTITY:location:Feywilds], where everyone - especially [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] and [ENTITY:npc:Jacques] - felt rejuvenated. [ENTITY:npc:Avarthel] refused to hatch the hydra eggs, citing the danger they posed. He agreed to store them securely but warned only druids in Ramashen could return them to the Fey, and the only known beastmaster was traveling to Icewind Dale. From him, they also learned thylacoleos could be distracted with honey.</p>

<p>After gathering potions from a charismatic, illusion-cloaked, naked drow named [ENTITY:npc:Jareth] - whom [ENTITY:character:Soshi] and [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] greatly admired - they visited [ENTITY:npc:Lem] at the barracks. [ENTITY:npc:Lem], a pudgy young guard, confessed that he hadn’t been serious about [ENTITY:npc:Anya] and hadn’t seen her in two weeks. She had often met him near a forest pond.</p>

<p>The party rushed to the location and found [ENTITY:npc:Anya], weak and bleeding, muttering deliriously that she had tried - and failed - to end her life and her unborn child’s. [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] knocked her out for safe transport while [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] comforted her. They brought her to [ENTITY:npc:Avarthel]’s grove, where a phoenix named Loïc shed tears that began her healing. [ENTITY:npc:Avarthel] took her deeper into the forest for long-term recovery.</p>

<p>Returning to town, the group stumbled into a tavern brawl - 15 drunk townsfolk against [ENTITY:npc:Vandal] and [ENTITY:npc:Summoner]. They subdued the chaos non-lethally, learning the fight had started when someone tried to grope [ENTITY:npc:Vandal]. After a short rest, they met [ENTITY:npc:Kat] and [ENTITY:npc:Yoghurt] again and entered the sunken temple.</p>

<p>The magical barrier let the party through, but not the thieves. The duo warned them to collapse the tunnels afterward. Inside, they found ancient ruins, skeletal remains, and two paths marked by carvings: a reptile and a storm cloud. The group chose the reptile path; the mercenaries took the other.</p>

<p>The air grew hotter and more humid as they navigated traps - [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] triggering one, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] another. A poisonous gas cloud, flaming runes, and venomous snakes and spiders challenged their stealth. At a leech-infested pond, they silently bypassed a monstrous red-eyed guardian using spells and clever movement.</p>

<p>In a flooded chamber with ruined walls, they found a note hinting at sinister plans: disciples of Demon Lords were creating monsters for some infernal tournament. A red glow in the water revealed treasure - but also piranhas and snakes. Worse, human-sized bats shrieked from the shadows.</p>

<p>They eventually reached a laboratory full of strange devices and dissected monsters. A huge reptile - the one from the door carving - leapt down to attack. [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] and [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] were struck with fear. [ENTITY:character:Soshi], blinking between planes, spotted approaching spiders. The creature’s freezing breath and crushing tail struck hard. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] landed a devastating critical hit, but the tide turned when [ENTITY:character:Soshi] polymorphed the beast into a harmless caterpillar.</p>

<p>Among the wreckage, they found jewelry, potions, a magical bow, and a helmet. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] received a message from the mercenaries - they were ready to press their rune. Doing so together caused the arena’s skeletons to collapse into the pit. A third passage opened - and the one behind them sealed shut.</p>
