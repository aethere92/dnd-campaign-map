<h3>II. Narrative Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Return to Drellin&rsquo;s Ferry and Soranna</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The party returned to Drellin&rsquo;s Ferry and met with Captain Soranna at the Tollhouse.</li>
	<li>Concerned about alarming townsfolk with their filthy state, Soranna led them to the basement for a private briefing.</li>
	<li>They recounted sightings of mauled corpses, green-cloaked figures, and a missing woodsman.</li>
	<li>Soranna, unfamiliar with hydras, marked the incidents on a map with red-flagged pins.</li>
	<li>She rewarded the party with 10 gold pieces and revealed:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>A vast cave system beneath the city, potentially a secret invasion route.</li>
		<li>Two agents would meet the party the following morning.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Bonnie recognized the agents as Kat (Tiefling, surrounded by cats and a tiger) and Yoghurt (half-ogre ninja, lactose-intolerant).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Green Apple Inn and Hydra Eggs</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The party returned to the inn to clean up.</li>
	<li>Soshi discovered two hydra eggs in her pack; the warmth and humidity made them at risk of hatching.</li>
	<li>Tharma informed them that Anya, a young assistant, had gone missing.</li>
	<li>At Anya&rsquo;s home:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Dried blood and a love letter to Lem (town guard) were found.</li>
		<li>Suspicious townsfolk observed them from the shadows.</li>
		<li>Gossip revealed Anya had been romantically involved with multiple men until six months prior.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Encounters with Winter Rose Mercenaries</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The party reunited with Vandal and Summoner, who had narrowly escaped an ambush in the eastern woods.</li>
	<li>Their attackers included giant raptors and thylacoleos, some marked with shackles, suggesting another hobgoblin clan.</li>
	<li>Raptors were afraid of fire and strong light.</li>
	<li>Tharma, the innkeeper, gifted Soshi a romance novel and updated the group on Lem&rsquo;s recovery at the barracks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Morning Meeting with Kat and Yoghurt</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Kat and Yoghurt shared information about the cave system:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Connected to an old temple, blocked by a magical barrier rejecting city affiliates.</li>
		<li>Only outsiders, like the party, could pass.</li>
		<li>Kat asked for gold to repay debts; the party refused.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Kat&rsquo;s globes contained cats and a tiger.</li>
	<li>The thieves feared the Winter Rose mercenaries and were cautious in revealing information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visit to Avarthel, the Druid</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Avarthel was mid-wedding when approached.</li>
	<li>Led the party to his grove near the Feywild, rejuvenating Bonnie, Jacques, and the others.</li>
	<li>Refused to hatch hydra eggs, citing ecological danger.</li>
	<li>Agreed to store eggs securely; only druids in Ramashen could return them to the Feywild.</li>
	<li>Provided tactical advice: thylacoleos could be distracted with honey.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potion Acquisition and Lem&rsquo;s Account</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Purchased ten lesser healing potions from Jareth, an illusion-cloaked, nearly nude drow.</li>
	<li>Visited Lem at the barracks:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Young, pudgy human guard, 1.5m tall.</li>
		<li>Confessed to a casual relationship with Anya; unaware of her pregnancy.</li>
		<li>Revealed meeting spot near a forest pond.</li>
		<li>Described recent attack by worg riders, resulting in minor injuries.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rescue of Anya</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Party found Anya weak, bleeding, delirious, attempting suicide.</li>
	<li>Kaedin rendered her unconscious for safe transport; Bonnie comforted her.</li>
	<li>Taken to Avarthel&rsquo;s grove, where Lo&iuml;c, a phoenix, shed healing tears.</li>
	<li>Avarthel escorted Anya deeper into the forest for long-term recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tavern Brawl</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Returning to the Green Apple Inn, the party found 10&ndash;15 drunken townsfolk attacking Vandal and Summoner.</li>
	<li>The brawl was non-lethally subdued; the fight started due to an attempted groping of Vandal.</li>
	<li>Tharma thanked the party for restoring order.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Into the Sunken Temple</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Joined Kat and Yoghurt; the party entered a partially submerged temple.</li>

	<li>They were instructed to collapse tunnels afterward.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stone Ring and Path Selection</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Found a superior stone ring with skeletal remains and weapons.</li>
	<li>Two doors: reptile carving (party) and storm cloud carving (mercenaries).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Discovered electronic devices, dissected monsters, and the arena entrance.</li>
	<li>A massive reptile attacked:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Kaedin and Olek became frightened.</li>
		<li>Soshi observed approaching spiders.</li>
		<li>Bonnie landed a critical hit, Kaedin dealt substantial damage.</li>
		<li>Soshi polymorphed the reptile into a harmless caterpillar, ending the combat.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
