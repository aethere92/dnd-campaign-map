<ul>
<li>The party returned to Drellin&rsquo;s Ferry and met with <strong>Captain [ENTITY:npc:Soranna]</strong> at the Tollhouse.</li>
<li>Concerned about alarming townsfolk with their filthy state, [ENTITY:npc:Soranna] led them to the <strong>basement</strong> for a private briefing.</li>
<li>They recounted sightings of <strong>mauled corpses, green-cloaked figures, and a missing woodsman</strong>.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:npc:Soranna], unfamiliar with <strong>hydras</strong>, marked the incidents on a map with <strong>red-flagged pins</strong>.</li>

<li>Two agents would meet the party the following morning.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The party returned to the inn to <strong>clean up</strong>.</li>

<ul>
