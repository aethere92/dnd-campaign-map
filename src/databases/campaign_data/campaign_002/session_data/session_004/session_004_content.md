<h3>Return to the Tollhouse</h3>

<p>The party's previous adventure had left them weary and, frankly, quite malodorous as they returned to [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry]. Making their way back to the familiar Tollhouse, they sought out [ENTITY:npc:Soranna], who took one look at their disheveled state and quickly ushered them down into the basement. The discrete location would allow them to speak freely without alarming the townspeople with their rather pungent aroma.</p>
<p>In the privacy of the basement, the party recounted their harrowing encounters with the attacks they had witnessed. [ENTITY:npc:Soranna] listened intently as they described the maimed corpses and the disappearance of at least one woodsman among the people dressed in green. When they mentioned the hydra, [ENTITY:npc:Soranna]'s puzzled expression revealed she had no knowledge of such creatures. As they spoke, she methodically placed red-flagged pins on a map, marking the locations of other similar attacks that had been reported.</p>
<p>Impressed by their efforts, [ENTITY:npc:Soranna] rewarded the party with 10 gold pieces. She then shared valuable intelligence about the growing threat, explaining that she had two skilled operatives under her command investigating the hordes. Of particular concern was an extensive cave system that sprawled beneath the city, which posed a significant risk as a potential infiltration route into [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry].</p>
<p>The two operatives, she explained, would seek out the party the following day to discuss their findings. When asked for their names, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]'s face lit up with recognition. [ENTITY:npc:Kat], a tiefling with an unusual passion for cats, and [ENTITY:npc:Yoghurt], a lactose-intolerant half-ogre assassin, were both former members of the [ENTITY:guild:Thieves Guild] who had been exiled to this town due to their rather questionable competence.</p>

<h3>The Green Apple Inn and a Disturbing Discovery</h3>

<p>Exhausted and still reeking from their adventures, the party made their way back to the [ENTITY:location:Green Apple Inn]. [ENTITY:npc:Tharma], the understanding bartender, immediately directed them back to their rooms with firm instructions to clean themselves thoroughly before rejoining civilized company.</p>
<p>As [ENTITY:character:Soshi] undressed and began to clean herself, she made a startling discovery - two eggs had somehow ended up in her possession. After consulting with [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] and [ENTITY:character:Kaedin], the trio realized with growing alarm that these were hydra eggs. The warm, humid conditions they had recently experienced meant the eggs could hatch at any moment.</p>
<p>Once cleaned and presentable, the party returned downstairs to find the common room populated with various patrons. Speaking with the barmaid, they learned troubling news: [ENTITY:npc:Anya], one of her young assistants, had gone missing two days prior. The girl was described as a 17-year-old human with striking red hair, standing about 1.8 meters tall, and bearing a distinctive pattern of freckles across her face.</p>

<h3>The Search for Anya</h3>

<p>After finishing their dinner, the party decided to investigate [ENTITY:npc:Anya]'s disappearance. Her house sat on the outskirts of town, nestled near the forest's edge. The simple thatched wooden structure stood beside a modest shed, both showing signs of recent abandonment.</p>
<p>Entering the darkened house, they found no signs of life. The simple interior contained only a bed and a nearby table, but what caught their attention was the blood on the floor - at least a day old by their estimation. The house showed no signs of ransacking, leading them to suspect that [ENTITY:npc:Anya] might have been pregnant.</p>
<p>Their careful search revealed an unfinished letter that provided a crucial clue:</p>
<p><blockquote><i>"[ENTITY:npc:Lem], you know I love you and I want us to be together. I'll go to our favourite meeting spot..."</blockquote></i></p>
<p>As they prepared to leave the house, the party became aware they were being watched. At least three pairs of eyes observed them from the shadows - townspeople who had been eavesdropping on their investigation. Approaching an elderly woman among the watchers, they inquired about [ENTITY:npc:Anya]'s whereabouts. While the woman claimed no knowledge of the girl's current location, she revealed that many men had been regular visitors to [ENTITY:npc:Anya]'s home until about six months ago.</p>

<h3>Encounters with the Winter Rose Mercenaries</h3>

<p>Returning to the inn, the party reunited with the [ENTITY:guild:Winter Rose] mercenaries, who had their own harrowing tale to share. Their recent expedition to the east had nearly ended in disaster when they were ambushed while pursuing a hidden stash. Giant raptors and Thylacoleos - fearsome panther-bear hybrids - had attacked them, devouring their horses. Ironically, this grisly sacrifice had provided the mercenaries with the distraction they needed to escape with their lives.</p>
<p>The mercenaries shared valuable tactical information: the raptors showed a marked fear of fire and strong light, and notably, there had been no hobgoblins among their attackers. However, the raptors bore distinctive markings that resembled shackles, suggesting they belonged to a different hobgoblin clan than those previously encountered.</p>
<p>After parting ways with the mercenaries, the party sought out [ENTITY:npc:Tharma] once more. They discovered she was an avid reader of Sandra Brown novels and even gifted one to the interested [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]. When asked about [ENTITY:npc:Lem], [ENTITY:npc:Tharma] revealed he was a member of the town guard.</p>
<p>With this information gathered, the party retired to their rooms for a well-deserved rest, and through their experiences, they felt themselves grow stronger, reaching the 7th level of their abilities.</p>
<p>[PROGRESSION:levelup:7]</p>

<h3>Morning Revelations</h3>

<p>The next morning brought the promised meeting with the two exiled thieves. Over breakfast, the party observed [ENTITY:npc:Yoghurt] approaching dressed in an elegant kimono with two katanas at his side, while [ENTITY:npc:Kat] appeared as one of the most unremarkable individuals imaginable - forgettable in every way except for the several large globes attached to his waist.</p>
<p>Through conversation conducted partly in thieves' cant, with [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] taking the lead, they learned that the pair harbored ambitions of robbing the local wizard. More importantly, [ENTITY:npc:Soranna] had tasked them with researching the cave system, and their findings were illuminating:</p>
<p>The caves extended beneath the city and were largely flooded. They connected to the temple near town but were protected by a barrier of light that prevented anyone affiliated with the city from passing through. This meant the party - and possibly the [ENTITY:guild:Winter Rose] mercenaries - could potentially bypass this magical obstacle. The wizard had described this barrier as a curse.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie]'s keen observation revealed that [ENTITY:npc:Kat]'s mysterious globes were actually cats and even a large tiger. The tiefling was in desperate need of 2 gold pieces to settle debts owed to wealthy townspeople, though none of the party felt inclined to assist with this particular financial burden.</p>
<p>Both thieves expressed considerable fear of the [ENTITY:guild:Winter Rose] mercenaries, referring to them only by their codenames: [ENTITY:npc:Vandal] and [ENTITY:npc:Summoner].</p>
<p>After the thieves departed, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] composed a letter for them, detailing information about the tunnel and suggesting they meet again later that day.</p>

<h3>Seeking Expert Counsel</h3>

<p>The party formulated a plan to visit both the local druid and wizard with their hydra eggs - hoping to convince the druid to hatch one while selling the other to the wizard for a substantial profit.</p>
<p>They found [ENTITY:npc:Avarthel], the druid, in the middle of officiating a wedding ceremony. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] discreetly sent him a message explaining the urgency of their matter. As he approached them afterward, they learned he belonged to the Circle of the Land. He led them to the forest's edge, into a beautiful grove of his own creation.</p>
<p>The grove's proximity to the [ENTITY:location:Feywild] had an immediate positive effect on everyone, particularly [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] and [ENTITY:npc:Jacques], who actually grew in size within this magical space. However, when [ENTITY:npc:Avarthel] examined their hydra eggs, his response was far from what they had hoped.</p>
<p>The druid adamantly refused to hatch the eggs, explaining that hydras were uncontrollable creatures capable of destroying entire ecosystems. He could not send them back to the Fey plane - only druids in Ramashen possessed such power. Similarly, taming these beasts was beyond their capabilities, and the only Beastmaster skilled enough for such a task was currently traveling to Icewind Dale.</p>
<p>Understanding the danger, the party agreed to leave the eggs in [ENTITY:npc:Avarthel]'s care under strict conditions that would prevent them from hatching.</p>
<p>During their continued conversation, [ENTITY:npc:Avarthel] shared additional useful information: Thylacoleos could be avoided using honey, as they would prioritize the sweet substance over attacking anyone who hadn't provoked them first. He also revealed that [ENTITY:npc:Lem] had been attacked during his guard shift, treated for his injuries, and was now recovering at the town barracks.</p>

<h3>Shopping and Unexpected Encounters</h3>

<p>Before visiting the barracks, the party decided to procure some healing potions. The shopping district buzzed with activity, and there they encountered [ENTITY:npc:Jareth] of House Corzina, a remarkably muscled drow who appeared to be hiding his nudity behind an illusion of clothing. Both [ENTITY:character:Soshi] and [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] found him quite appealing.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:npc:Jareth]'s story proved intriguing: his matron, Zaya, had sent him to this town twenty years ago with instructions to remain until he received a specific signal - one he had yet to see. Their society followed a matriarchal structure, explaining his deference to his absent matron's commands.</p>
<p>The party successfully purchased ten lesser healing potions (4d4 + 4 healing each) for 5 gold pieces total, with each member receiving two potions for their personal use.</p>

<h3>The Barracks and Lem's Account</h3>

<p>At the barracks, they discovered [ENTITY:npc:Soranna] was away, but they were granted access to the infirmary where [ENTITY:npc:Lem] was recovering. The young man proved to be quite different from what they had expected - a rotund human of only 1.5 meters in height and 19 years of age. His appearance left everyone wondering what exactly [ENTITY:npc:Anya] had seen in him.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:npc:Lem]'s account of their relationship was rather callous. He admitted he hadn't taken their connection seriously and had been "just having fun," remaining oblivious to how serious the relationship had become for [ENTITY:npc:Anya]. He claimed ignorance about any pregnancy and revealed he hadn't seen her for two weeks.</p>
<p>Their secret meeting place, he explained, required a four-hour walk through the forest to reach a secluded pond. Regarding his recent attack, [ENTITY:npc:Lem] described being assaulted by two worg riders, resulting in his fall onto a boulder. Two other guards had also been injured in the encounter, though fortunately, no one had died.</p>

<h3>Rescue in the Forest</h3>

<p>Prioritizing [ENTITY:npc:Anya]'s welfare over their other concerns, the party set off for the forest meeting place. Their decision proved fortuitous, as they found the young woman in a dire state. Blood stained her ankles, and she appeared nearly delirious, singing incoherently while repeatedly muttering about her failed attempts to end both her own life and that of her unborn child.</p>
<p>Recognizing the critical nature of her condition, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] made the difficult decision to render her unconscious while [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] provided a comforting distraction with an embrace. [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] then carried her unconscious form toward [ENTITY:npc:Avarthel]'s grove, accompanied by [ENTITY:character:Soshi], while [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] rushed ahead to bring the druid to help.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the magical grove, [ENTITY:npc:Anya]'s condition immediately began to improve. A phoenix named Loic, who had been residing in the area, took notice of her plight and shed healing tears upon her, further stabilizing her condition. When [ENTITY:npc:Avarthel] arrived, having transformed into a cheetah for swift travel, he determined that [ENTITY:npc:Anya] needed extended care and took her deeper into the forest for both physical and mental healing.</p>

<h3>Tavern Brawl</h3>

<p>Returning to the [ENTITY:location:Green Apple Inn], the party walked directly into chaos. Bottles flew through the air and random punches were being thrown as 10-15 intoxicated townspeople engaged in a massive brawl. At the center of the conflict were [ENTITY:npc:Vandal] and [ENTITY:npc:Summoner], the [ENTITY:guild:Winter Rose] mercenaries.</p>
<p>The party quickly intervened, carefully avoiding serious injury to the drunk participants while efficiently knocking them unconscious to end the fight. [ENTITY:npc:Tharma] expressed her gratitude for their assistance as they helped remove the unconscious troublemakers from her establishment.</p>
<p>Once order was restored, they learned from [ENTITY:npc:Vandal] and [ENTITY:npc:Summoner] that the brawl had erupted when the drunken townspeople had attempted to inappropriately grab [ENTITY:npc:Vandal]'s chest.</p>

<h3>Into the Depths</h3>

<p>After taking a short rest to recover their strength, the party joined the mercenaries to meet with [ENTITY:npc:Kat] and [ENTITY:npc:Yoghurt]. They found the thieving duo engaged in petty crime, with [ENTITY:npc:Kat] having just stolen fish from a vendor's stall and fleeing from the scene.</p>
<p>The group proceeded toward the temple, which was partially submerged underwater, and approached the mysterious barrier. As expected, the party passed through easily, while [ENTITY:npc:Kat] and [ENTITY:npc:Yoghurt] were prevented from entering. The thieves instructed them to collapse the caves if possible, ensuring they couldn't be used as an infiltration route into the town.</p>
<p>Venturing deeper into the cave system, they discovered a stone entryway covered in indecipherable runes. Beyond this lay an impressive sight: a large superior ring, six meters in width, overlooking an arena littered with approximately fifty skeletal remains and scattered weaponry throughout.</p>
<p>Two entrances beckoned from atop the ring - one to the right bearing the carving of a large reptile, and one to the left decorated with a cloud surrounded by multiple lightning bolts.</p>
<p>The party chose the right entrance while the mercenaries took the left path.</p>

<h3>The Reptilian Path</h3>

<p>Approximately ten minutes into their journey, they heard thunderous sounds echoing from the mercenaries' chosen route. Meanwhile, their own tunnel grew increasingly hot and humid - a fortunate circumstance that they had left the hydra eggs behind with [ENTITY:npc:Avarthel].</p>
<p>Their progress was soon impeded by a large poisonous cloud stretching fifteen feet across their path. [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] attempted to leap over the obstacle but landed on a concealed trap, suffering 4 points of damage. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] rushed through the poisonous cloud and triggered a fire trap, which she managed to dodge, though [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] caught the full force of the flames for an additional 12 points of damage. Once the poison cloud dissipated, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] was able to pass through safely.</p>
<p>This dangerous encounter convinced the party to proceed with greater caution. They invoked [ENTITY:spell:Pass without Trace] to mask their movements and continued stealthily through the increasingly treacherous environment.</p>
<p>The sounds of shrieking and chittering grew louder as they progressed, and they soon discovered the source: a pit filled with large snakes and spiders that moved freely through openings in the tunnel walls.</p>
<p>Further along, they encountered a pond inhabited by giant leeches, beside which slumbered a massive creature with glowing red eyes. Recognizing the need to bypass both the pond and avoid waking the sleeping beast, they employed their various magical abilities - [ENTITY:character:Soshi] used [ENTITY:spell:Misty Step], [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] cast [ENTITY:spell:Fly], and [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] teleported to his Echo.</p>
<p>At this moment, the entire temple structure shook violently, adding urgency to their mission.</p>

<h3>The Laboratory of Horrors</h3>

<p>They emerged into a vast chamber, partially flooded and containing the ruins of what had once been a substantial structure. Within the remains of a house, they discovered a crumpled note that revealed the sinister purpose of this place:</p>
<p><blockquote><i>"The experiment is going well. Me and the other disciples opened several gates to two of the Demon Lords' domains. We should be close to easily lure out enough creatures to start a breeding program to provide enough competitors for the games."</i></blockquote></p>
<p>The chamber also contained a mysterious red glow emanating from beneath the water, where a chest rested on the bottom. However, the water teemed with piranhas and snakes, making retrieval extremely dangerous. Above them, they realized the source of the shrieking sounds they had been hearing - human-sized bats roosted in the chamber's upper reaches.</p>
<p>As they continued deeper, the environment grew noticeably colder, and they began to notice that the tracks on the floor had become slimy and sticky, suggesting the presence of some large creature.</p>

<h3>The Final Laboratory</h3>

<p>Their journey culminated in a room filled with electronic gadgets and scientific equipment. Multiple tables held the remains of various creatures they had encountered throughout their underground expedition. An entrance to the arena was visible, marked by a rune that appeared to be designed for activation.</p>
<p>At the back of the room stood the very reptile whose likeness had been carved into the entrance wall at the beginning of their journey.</p>
<p>When [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] summoned his Echo, the massive reptile sprang into action, leaping an incredible 45 feet to attack them, initiating what would prove to be a challenging battle.</p>

<h3>The Battle with the Reptile</h3>

<p>The combat began with [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] hurling a javelin at their scaly opponent, followed by [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]'s own attack. [ENTITY:character:Soshi] wisely used her [ENTITY:spell:Blink] spell and discovered that spiders were approaching to assist the reptile in the fight.</p>
<p>The reptile retaliated with devastating effect, causing both [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] and [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] to fail their saving throws and become [ENTITY:spell:Fear:frightened]. Its tail attack successfully struck [ENTITY:character:Kaedin], adding to his mounting injuries.</p>
<p>On [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]'s turn, despite unleashing four attacks, only one found its mark, though it dealt a substantial 23 points of damage including a grazing hit.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie]'s continued assault proved more successful, landing a critical hit that dealt 36 points of damage. The significant injury caused the reptile to begin emanating an aura of cold, indicating its desperation and rising power.</p>
<p>However, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] ended the immediate threat with brilliant tactical thinking, using her [ENTITY:spell:polymorph] spell to transform the dangerous reptile into a harmless caterpillar, bringing the combat to an abrupt and decisive conclusion.</p>

<h3>Spoils of Victory and the Final Puzzle</h3>

<p>With the battle won, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] searched the area and discovered valuable treasures: jewelry worth 10 gold pieces, two vials containing mysterious elixirs, a magical bow, and an enchanted helmet.</p>
[PROGRESSION:loot:reptile-loot-01]

<p>As they approached the rune that would activate the arena mechanism, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] received a message from the mercenaries indicating they were ready to press their corresponding rune. In perfect synchronization, both groups activated their respective runes.</p>

<p>The results were immediately visible: the door opened, and all the skeletal remains in the arena were pulled into the central pit. Had they failed to coordinate this action, all the skeletons would have animated, creating a far more dangerous situation.</p>

<p>With the arena's trap successfully bypassed, a third corridor opened before them. As they entered this new passage, the room behind them sealed shut, leaving them no choice but to continue forward into whatever mysteries lay ahead.</p>
