<p>The party entered a vast cavern network marked by evidence of dark rituals, decay, and imprisonment. They found rows of cages holding various creatures’ skulls and strong lingering traces of conjuration magic. An adjacent camp revealed empty weapon racks and the personal tent of a mage, Kalistra of the Brotherhood. A partially burned ledger, magically protected, revealed that Kalistra was sending all collected creatures to someone named Kilgor for an event called the "Festival of Life." The ledger also mentioned that Kilgor was collecting combatants who survived "arena trials," and that the Brotherhood had failed to send expected reinforcements. The final legible note referenced a departure for Luskan with pirates and a hidden treasure at "the old fort north of the woods." [ENTITY:character:Norr] recognized Kalistra as a harsh former teacher who specialized in alteration magic and had vanished a decade prior.</p>

<p>Venturing deeper, the party encountered Megatherium, massive prehistoric creatures that resembled a cross between a bear and a sloth. [ENTITY:character:Norr], suffering a psychic spike from the influx of Kalistra's taught knowledge, identified them as herbivores valued for their ability to consume insects and used by the Broken Shackle orc tribe. The creatures, though peaceful unless provoked by insects, bore the orc tribe's mark.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] bravely befriended two of the Megatherium, which she named Gică and Mișu, successfully mounting one. She learned that the Megatherium's former handlers had abandoned them two weeks prior after answering a call from the Red Hand.</p>

<p>The party was then ambushed by Spitters, gigantic, acidic millipede-like creatures associated with the goblin Te Snatchers clan. [ENTITY:character:Olek]'s armor was severely damaged by the creatures’ acidic blood, and [ENTITY:character:Norr] suffered another mind-spike of painful knowledge. The Megatherium proved invaluable, their peaceful demeanor replaced by devastating speed and aggression against the insect-like monsters, allowing the party to defeat them and their Drider handlers. In the aftermath, the group harvested valuable venom and identified Garlic Agaricoms—toxic mushrooms that could be used to create a potent paralyzing poison.</p>

<p>Following a thunderous crash, the party was reunited with [ENTITY:npc:Vandal] and the [ENTITY:npc:Summoner], who had discovered a partially submerged ship. Before information could be exchanged, [ENTITY:npc:Vandal] finished a spell that blew out the cavern wall. The ship, caught in a massive surge of water, rocketed through the collapsing cave system.</p>

<p>The journey was chaotic, with debris raining down and the entire system failing, until the ship shot out of a waterfall on the side of a mountain, crashing into the sea below. Battered and soaking, the survivors clung to the wreckage.</p>

<p>They were approached by a massive galleon flying a jolly roger. As rescue boats were launched, the party realized the crew was a bizarre mix of pirates and fully armored paladins. A voice from the galleon greeted them and extended an invitation from Captain Bianca Turiados. Several party members, particularly [ENTITY:character:Olek], were shocked, as they recognized the name as that of the paladin commander [ENTITY:character:Olek] had been seeking. Hauling the exhausted adventurers aboard, the unexpected alliance of pirates and paladins suggested that the conspiracy involving Kilgor, the Brotherhood, and various factions was far more extensive than they had imagined.</p>
