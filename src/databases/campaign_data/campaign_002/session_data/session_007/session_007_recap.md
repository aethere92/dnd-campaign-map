<p>The session began with the party arriving at an inn, weary from travel. They were treated to a unique, invigorating mushroom and exotic herb stew, which unexpectedly granted them temporary hit points. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], the pixie rogue, secluded herself to safely release her magical feline companion, a practice soon adopted by the rest of the group.</p>

<p>The adventurers who possessed the powerful, juvenile, leopard-sized magical cats released them for their mandatory 48-hour maturation period. [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]’s two pets immediately ate their way out of his room to hunt, returning with a grotesque pile of local fauna (mice, pigeons, dogs, etc.) and a massive hole in the wall. [ENTITY:character:Norr]'s cat scaled and clawed her walls and ceiling, while [ENTITY:character:Olek]’s cat, Palo, ransacked the kitchen, causing the innkeeper to pass out and screaming upon waking. [ENTITY:character:Olek] smoothed things over by paying a generous gold coin for the damages, though the sight of [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]'s chewed-out wall led to an expensive, ongoing repair fee. With the destructive potential of their pets clear, the party returned the creatures to their spheres.</p>

<p>The party spent the morning restocking. In the bustling market, they procured new clothing, supplies, and a large quantity of milk and various honeys—including an exotic variety vital for training powerful magical mounts. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], ever vigilant, noticed she was being watched and used the opportunity to contact a thieves’ guild acquaintance for new tools.</p>

<p>They next visited the armorer, using a discount note to purchase new gear: Splint Mail for [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] and Chain Mail for [ENTITY:character:Olek]. They sold two of their rare "Taylas" pelts and used the third to reinforce their newly bought armor and [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]’s leather gear, granting added resistance to damage.</p>

<p>While the armor was being reinforced, they reported their successful temple investigation to Captain Sorana, who informed them that pirates had recently been in the harbor. She paid them 20 gold pieces for their service and assigned them a new mission: investigate the disappearance of four barbarian riders in the Witchwood, a dense forest to the northwest.</p>

<p>On the road to the Witchwood, they encountered the smoldering wreckage of two caravans and a massacre of ten innocents. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]’s tracking revealed the culprits to be at least twenty Orcs on Warg-back, heading in the same direction.</p>

<p>The tracks led them to a clearing containing a ruined fortress. The land around it felt strangely cleansed by powerful abjuration magic. After scouting the area, they located a stable where a group of Hobgoblins was playing dice. A skeleton patrolled the main keep wall.</p>

<p>The party quickly launched a surprise attack. [ENTITY:character:Soshi] cast Grease, and [ENTITY:character:Norr] followed with a devastating Fireball, igniting the stable and killing several enemies. The courtyard instantly erupted into chaos as two Wargs, two Hobgoblin Warg-riders, a hulking Minotaur, a Mud Elemental that rose from the ground, and a terrifying Manticore all emerged to confront them. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] realized the enemy was expecting them.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek], charging forward, was immediately snatched by the Manticore and carried into the sky, where the creature poisoned him. The remaining Hobgoblin shaman retaliated, casting a spell that blinded [ENTITY:character:Norr]. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], using invisibility, assassinated a shaman before he could react. [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] used his [ENTITY:subclass:Echo Knight] abilities to flank the riders, while [ENTITY:character:Soshi] defended herself from the Minotaur.</p>

<p>The tide turned when [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] destroyed the Mud Elemental, and [ENTITY:character:Olek], plummeting from the Manticore’s grasp, managed to crash-land on the battlement, where he dispatched the last Hobgoblin archer. Seeing their forces dwindle, the final shaman and the Minotaur fled through the main gate, but not before shouting a final, ominous warning: "Alert the Wormlord!" The party stood victorious, having survived the desperate siege and now faced with the name of a new, unknown threat.</p>
