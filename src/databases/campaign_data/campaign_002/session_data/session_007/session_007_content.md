<h3>An Uneasy Respite</h3>

<p>The party arrived at the inn weary and travel-worn, the day's combat having left them in dire need of rest. It was eight o'clock in the evening, and the common room was surprisingly quiet as they entered. The source of the tranquility soon became apparent; the innkeeper, a woman with an adventurous culinary spirit, was experimenting with a new stew. An intensely aromatic and pleasant scent, a mix of mushrooms and exotic herbs, wafted from the kitchen, promising a unique meal.</p>

<p>While most of the party was drawn to the scent of food and the promise of a soft bed, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], the pixie rogue, had other priorities. Announcing her immediate need for sleep, she declared she would be taking a room alone. The decision was a practical one; she needed a secure and isolated space to tend to her mystical feline companion, believing it would be safer for everyone if she were the only one present when releasing the creature from its dimensional confinement. With a quick farewell, she headed upstairs, leaving her companions to their own devices.</p>

<p>Downstairs, the rest of the group gathered around the innkeeper, who offered them a taste of her new creation. She admitted it was a first attempt and offered it for free, though she playfully warned them of potential digestive distress. [ENTITY:character:Olek], ever the faithful paladin, offered to bless the meal, a gesture that brought a curious smile to the innkeeper's face. The stew, which had the exotic flair of an Indian dish, was surprisingly delicious. More than that, it was invigorating; all who partook felt a surge of vitality, granting them a small buffer of temporary hit points. Pleased with the experimental meal and the unexpected boon, [ENTITY:character:Norr] and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] complimented the innkeeper profusely on her culinary skill. After another serving, the group felt the day's exhaustion weighing heavily upon them and decided it was time to retire for the night. They secured separate rooms, the cost waived in light of their previous assistance to the town.</p>

<h3>A Night of Feline Mayhem</h3>

<p>In the privacy of their individual rooms, the adventurers who possessed the mysterious Pokeball-like spheres decided the time was right to let their powerful feline companions out. These were not common house cats, but juvenile magical beasts, closer in size and ferocity to leopards, who required 48 hours outside their containers to mature into their next stage of development.</p>

<p>In his room, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] released his two cats. The moment they materialized, he noticed they were famished. He produced two bottles of milk, which they eagerly consumed. The beasts, whose natures were brave and strong, seemed satisfied for the moment, and the tired fighter settled down on the floor to sleep, leaving his bed to his formidable pets.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Norr], too, let her cat out. It was a patient creature, and upon its release, it simply sat and looked at her expectantly. After drinking a full bottle of milk, it showed its affection by licking her face, covering her in a mixture of milk and saliva. After an hour of reading aloud to her surprisingly attentive companion, [ENTITY:character:Norr] finally drifted off to sleep.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi]’s cat, true to its patient nature, was also hungry. Using her ability to speak with animals, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] promised it more food in the morning and managed to coax it into a peaceful slumber on her bed after it finished its milk.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in her barricaded room, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] had let her own cat out. After a successful Animal Handling check, she found the creature to be calm and obedient. She fed it, and the two settled in for what she hoped would be a quiet night.</p>

<p>The dawn, however, broke not with the gentle crowing of a rooster, but with a powerful, blood-curdling scream from downstairs. The party was jolted awake to a scene of absolute chaos, each discovering the nocturnal adventures of their supposedly resting pets.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] awoke to a charnel house. His two cats, no longer peacefully sleeping, were snoring soundly at the foot of his bed, covered in bruises. Next to them lay a grotesque pile of their night's hunt: five mice, three pigeons, two dogs, three other cats, and a large seagull. Looking around the room, he saw the source of their bruises and his new problem. A massive, one-meter-square hole had been chewed through the wooden wall of his room, offering a clear and breezy view of the street outside. The cats had literally eaten their way out to go hunting.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Norr] was greeted by a far more peaceful, yet still concerning, sight. Her cat was waiting patiently by the door, head bowed, the very picture of innocence. It was only when she looked closer that she noticed the deep, distinctive claw marks gouged into the walls and ceiling all around the room. The creature had clearly spent the night testing its climbing abilities, successfully scaling every available surface. Thinking quickly, she used her makeup kit to find a chalky color similar to the walls and began trying to conceal the evidence of her pet’s vertical explorations.</p>

<p>Downstairs, the source of the scream became horrifyingly clear. [ENTITY:character:Olek] rushed down to find the innkeeper passed out on the floor of her kitchen. Standing proudly beside her was his cat, Palo. The room was a disaster zone. The remnants of the experimental stew were gone, two large, empty jars of honey lay shattered on the floor, and another bottle of milk was broken. Palo, seeing his master, trotted over proudly as if to say, “Father, I have fed myself.” It then darted behind the counter and returned, dragging another half-eaten jar of honey as an offering.</p>

<p>When the innkeeper awoke, she was hysterical, babbling about a "monster" and a "tiger" that had attacked her. [ENTITY:character:Olek], displaying a paladin’s tact, attempted to calm her, explaining the situation with the magical cats as gently as he could. He offered to pay for all the damages, placing a single gold coin on the table—a generous sum that more than covered the destroyed provisions.</p>

<p>As the party gathered in the common room, the full extent of the night's destruction came to light. The innkeeper, now somewhat mollified by [ENTITY:character:Olek]'s payment, went to inspect the rooms. She was impressed by the apparent tidiness of [ENTITY:character:Norr]’s room, her deception check holding for the moment. However, upon entering [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]’s room, another scream echoed through the inn. The sight of the massive hole in the wall left her speechless. The gold coin [ENTITY:character:Olek] had provided suddenly seemed far less generous. She declared the room would cost five silver pieces per night until it was repaired, a fee [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] would have to cover. The party, now fully aware of the destructive potential of their companions, wisely decided it was best to return them to their spheres for the time being.</p>

<h3>Restocking in Town</h3>

<p>With the morning’s chaos somewhat settled, the party’s attention turned to their lack of proper gear. [ENTITY:character:Olek] and [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] were without armor, and several members of the party were in desperate need of new clothes and supplies. They also needed to procure a steady supply of milk and honey for their voracious pets. They possessed a discount note given to them by a man named Noro, which they intended to use at the local armorer.</p>

<p>Their first stop was the bustling town market. The square was teeming with vendors and townsfolk, a lively scene of commerce and community. However, a somber undercurrent ran through the crowd; many people were crying, and missing posters for lost dogs and cats were plastered on nearly every surface, a grim testament to the nocturnal hunting of [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]'s pets.</p>

<p>As they navigated the crowd, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]’s keen eyes, honed by a life of vigilance, noticed she was being watched. A young, inconspicuous street urchin approached her, asking for money. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], recognizing a kindred spirit, gave the child a few coins. A moment later, the child returned with a bundle of tattered but clean rags, offering them as clothing. The exchange was a brief, silent acknowledgment between two people who understood the harsh realities of the street. During this time, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] also took the opportunity to subtly contact another of her acquaintances in the thieve’s guild, arranging to purchase a new set of thieves’ tools.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin], who was still shirtless, drew the ire of a grumpy old man who chastised him for his indecent exposure. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], ever the trickster, couldn’t resist. She sent a telepathic message into the old man’s mind, making him believe he was hearing voices. The man, thoroughly spooked, hurried away towards the town shrine to pray, much to [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]’s amusement.</p>

<p>The group eventually found a vendor selling over thirty different varieties of honey, from common wildflower to exotic tropical flower honey that glowed with a faint pink hue. Recalling lessons from her past, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] recognized the exotic honey as a key ingredient used in the training of powerful magical mounts. Though expensive, they decided it was a worthwhile investment for the future potential of their feline companions. They purchased several medium-sized jars for the road and one enormous barrel to leave in safe-keeping at the inn, ensuring they wouldn’t run out of the vital food source.</p>

<p>Next, they made their way to the General Store, a fine establishment run by a very well-dressed man named Jaret. Their primary goal was to sell a collection of gems and eight pearls they had acquired. Jaret examined the goods with a practiced eye. He informed them that the gems would fetch a much higher price if they were properly cut and set by a jeweler, a service not available in this small town. As for the pearls, he delivered the unfortunate news that they were clever fakes. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], however, employed her considerable charm and a bit of creative storytelling about how she acquired them from fallen mercenaries, attempting to salvage the deal. While Jaret was not entirely convinced, her performance was persuasive enough that he agreed to purchase the crystals for ten gold pieces.</p>

<p>With some coin in hand, they turned their attention to clothing. [ENTITY:character:Soshi] and [ENTITY:character:Norr], tired of their travel-stained robes, purchased elegant new dresses. [ENTITY:character:Soshi] chose a finely crafted blue sorcerer’s robe, while [ENTITY:character:Norr] selected an identical one in a different color. [ENTITY:character:Kaedin], meanwhile, settled for a simple but sturdy peasant’s shirt and a pair of linen trousers.</p>

<h3>The Armorer's Forge</h3>

<p>Their supplies replenished, the party crossed the town bridge to the other side, where the rhythmic clang of hammer on steel announced the location of the armorer's forge. The business was run by a peculiar pair: a tiny dwarf who worked inside, surrounded by scaffolding to reach his projects, and a gnome woman who manned the large forge outside, hammering glowing plates of metal into shape.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek] presented their discount note from Noro, which the dwarf inspected with a nod of approval. "I like Noro. He's a good counselor," he grunted, offering them a twenty percent discount on all his gear.</p>

<p>The party surveyed the impressive array of armor. [ENTITY:character:Kaedin], seeking a balance of protection and mobility, was drawn to a suit of Splint Mail. [ENTITY:character:Olek], favoring heavy protection, chose a sturdy set of Chain Mail. They also inquired about reinforcing their new armor with the three mysterious "Taylas" pelts they carried. The smith examined the pelts with great interest, recognizing their unique properties. He explained that the hide was not native to this region and offered to reinforce three suits of armor for one gold piece each, a process that would take a few hours. He also offered to buy the pelts outright for five gold each.</p>

<p>After a brief discussion, they decided to sell two of the pelts and use the third to reinforce their newly purchased armor as well as [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]'s leather armor. The total cost, after the discounts and the sale of the pelts, came to a manageable sum, which they paid from their party funds. While the smith and his partner began the reinforcement process, the party decided to use the waiting time to report their findings to the town's guard captain.</p>

<h3>A New Contract</h3>

<p>They found Captain Sorana in the barracks courtyard, drilling a squad of ten new recruits. The fighters were clumsy, their spear wall formation more of a porous fence than a solid defense. [ENTITY:character:Olek] and [ENTITY:character:Kaedin], both seasoned warriors, couldn't help but step in. They spent the next hour shouting corrections, demonstrating proper stances, and running the recruits through rigorous drills. While their pedagogical skills were average at best, their knowledge of military tactics was undeniable, and by the end of the hour, the recruits’ formation was noticeably improved. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], meanwhile, used her Mage Hand to mischievously unbuckle the belts of the soldiers who were distracted by [ENTITY:character:Norr] and [ENTITY:character:Soshi]’s new dresses, causing their trousers to fall and injecting a moment of levity into the serious training.</p>

<p>Once the training was concluded, they gave Sorana a full report of their expedition into the temple ruins. They described the hellish creatures they had faced, the dark tomes they had discovered, and the eventual collapse of the caves. They also told her about their encounter with the pirates, explaining that the pirate crew had sailed north and were not an immediate threat to the town. Sorana listened intently, her expression growing more serious with each detail. She informed them that three ships in the harbor had been robbed, confirming the pirates' passage. For their successful investigation of the temple, she was authorized to pay them a fee of twenty gold pieces.</p>

<p>Their report concluded, Sorana gave them a new task. Four of her barbarian riders had gone missing while scouting in the Witchwood, a dense forest to the northwest. She marked a location on their map where they were last seen and asked the party to investigate. With their armor nearly ready and a new objective in hand, the party agreed.</p>

<h3>The Road to the Witchwood</h3>

<p>After picking up their newly reinforced armor from the forge, the party prepared to leave town. The enhancements were significant, granting them added resistance to both physical and magical damage. As they were about to depart, they decided to take the large barrel of honey with them rather than leave it at the inn, loading it onto [ENTITY:character:Olek]'s spectral steed.</p>

<p>They set out on the road leading northwest, letting their feline companions out of their spheres to travel alongside them. The cats, invigorated by the fresh air and the promise of a journey, bounded ahead, their powerful forms a stark contrast to the peaceful countryside.</p>

<p>Several hours into their journey, a grim sight brought them to a halt. Ahead, the smoldering remains of two large caravans lay wrecked by the side of the road. The air was thick with the smell of smoke and death. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], ever the scout, moved ahead stealthily to investigate. The scene was a massacre. Ten bodies, mostly human men, women, and children, were scattered amongst the wreckage. There were no signs of a struggle; it appeared they had been cut down as they tried to flee. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]’s expert tracking revealed the culprits: the tracks of at least twenty Orcs on Warg-back, leading away from the carnage to the northwest—the same direction the party was headed. The attack was recent, having occurred the previous evening. The party proceeded with heightened caution, the grim discovery a stark reminder of the dangers that lay ahead.</p>

<p>As they drew closer to the Witchwood, the path became less clear. The forest ahead seemed unnaturally dead, the trees twisted and lifeless. The Orc tracks they had been following were now deliberately hidden, covered with branches and brush. Pushing through the dying trees, they soon emerged into a clearing and beheld their destination: a ruined fortress.</p>

<p>The sight was both eerie and strangely beautiful. The land around the fortress felt cleansed, as if a powerful and benevolent magic had recently washed away a great darkness. [ENTITY:character:Soshi] could feel the pulse of powerful abjuration magic in the soil, a deep, protective ward. [ENTITY:character:Norr] felt something different, a feeling of spring and renewal, of new life pushing through the remnants of decay. Yet, a stark contradiction to this feeling of peace stood atop the single remaining battlement of the fortress: a large skeleton, slowly and methodically patrolling the wall.</p>

<h3>Trial by Fire</h3>

<p>The party approached the fortress with caution, using the crumbling outer walls for cover. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], using her pixie flight, ascended to get a better view of the courtyard. She saw a set of stables along the right wall, a ruined tower with a caved-in roof, and the main keep in the back, where the skeleton continued its silent patrol. The courtyard itself was littered with large boulders from the collapsed walls, but she saw no signs of an occupying army.</p>

<p>As she relayed this information, a low murmur of voices drifted from one of the stables. The language was harsh and guttural: Goblin. Peeking through a crack in the wooden door, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] saw a group of Hobgoblins inside, engrossed in a game of dice.</p>

<p>A whispered plan quickly formed. [ENTITY:character:Soshi] would cast Grease to make the ground slick and flammable, and [ENTITY:character:Norr] would follow up with a devastating Fireball. The party repositioned themselves near the main gate as the two spellcasters prepared their assault.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi]’s spell went first, a sheet of slick grease spreading across the ground in front of the stables. An instant later, [ENTITY:character:Norr] unleashed her Fireball. The magical explosion tore through the first stable, the wooden structure erupting in a torrent of flame. The plan worked, perhaps too well.</p>

<p>The courtyard exploded into chaos. Two Wargs, their fur alight, burst from the burning stables, howling in agony. They were followed by several Hobgoblin warriors, their armor scorched and smoking. From the ruined tower with the caved-in roof, a terrifying new foe emerged. A Manticore, with the body of a lion, the wings of a dragon, and the tail of a scorpion, let out a piercing roar as it took to the sky. From a nearby barracks, two more Hobgoblin riders on Wargs charged into the fray, and from a side building, a hulking, one-eyed Minotaur stomped into the courtyard, brandishing a massive spear. As if that weren’t enough, the very earth began to tremble, and one of the large boulders in the courtyard rose up, forming into a hulking Mud Elemental. The party was surrounded.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek], fearless, charged forward, his Aasimar wings flaring to life. He met the first Hobgoblin head-on, his battleaxe glowing with holy light as he channeled his divine power, cleaving the creature with a single, mighty blow. But his bravery made him a target. The Manticore swooped down from above, its powerful claws easily bypassing his defenses. It grabbed the paladin and soared back into the sky, carrying him high above the battlefield.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi] unleashed a volley of Scorching Rays at the Warg riders, but the nimble beasts dodged most of the fiery blasts. [ENTITY:character:Norr], seeing the cluster of enemies, unleashed another Fireball, this one aimed at the Hobgoblins. The explosion engulfed them, killing one outright and severely wounding the others. But in the chaos, a Hobgoblin shaman retaliated, casting a spell that shrouded [ENTITY:character:Norr] in magical darkness, blinding her completely.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] moved like a shadow through the chaos. Becoming invisible, she darted past the front lines and appeared behind one of the shamans. Her daggers flashed, a flurry of precise strikes that left the spellcaster dead before he could react. "They know it's us!" she called out to her companions. "They were waiting for us!"</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] used his [ENTITY:subclass:Echo Knight] ability, teleporting his echo across the battlefield to flank the charging riders. His greatsword was a blur, cutting down one of the Wargs. The Mud Elemental lumbered towards Adi, slamming its massive fists into him, the blows heavy and crushing. The Minotaur charged [ENTITY:character:Soshi], its horns aimed to gore her, but she deftly dodged aside.</p>

<p>The battle raged. [ENTITY:character:Norr], though blind, attempted to cast a cone of draconic energy, but her spell went wide in her disorientation. The Minotaur, seeing her vulnerability, charged and grabbed her, its powerful grip restraining her. [ENTITY:character:Olek], still in the Manticore's clutches high above, was subjected to the creature's venomous tail stinger, poison coursing through his veins and turning his limbs sluggish.</p>

<p>Seeing [ENTITY:character:Norr] in peril, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] rushed to her aid. Her blades were a blur as she dispatched the Hobgoblin warrior menacing the sorcerer. [ENTITY:character:Kaedin], meanwhile, held the line against the Mud Elemental and another Warg rider, his armor dented but his resolve unbroken. The wall of fire from the burning stables began to spread, collapsing the structure and sending a wave of heat and flame across the courtyard, catching several of the enemies in the blaze.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the Manticore released its grip on [ENTITY:character:Olek]. The paladin plummeted towards the earth. Mustering all his strength, he angled his body, gliding towards the battlement where the lone Hobgoblin archer stood. He crashed into the stone wall, the impact jarring but not fatal, leaving him stuck in one of the crenellations but safe from the deadly fall.</p>

<p>Back on the ground, [ENTITY:character:Norr], still held by the Minotaur, managed to cast Misty Step, teleporting out of its grasp and behind a large boulder. Her cats, who had been hiding in the tall grass, rushed to her side and chewed through the ropes the Minotaur had used to bind her wrists.</p>

<p>The tide of the battle began to turn. [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] unleashed a powerful blow against the Mud Elemental, the magical force of his strike causing the creature to crumble into a pile of inert mud. [ENTITY:character:Olek], now free, leaped down from the battlement and engaged the archer, his radiant blade cutting the Hobgoblin down.</p>

<p>Seeing their forces dwindling, the last remaining shaman shouted a final, desperate order in the Goblin tongue. "Alert the Wormlord!" He and the remaining Minotaur turned and fled through the main gate, disappearing from sight. The combat was over. The party stood victorious amidst the fire and carnage, battered and bruised, but alive. A new, ominous name echoed in their minds: the Wormlord.</p>
