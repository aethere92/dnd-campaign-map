<h3>II. Narrative Summary</h3>
<p><strong>The Onslaught Begins</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The session opened immediately after the explosion that breached the ritual chamber wall.</li>
	<li>Through the hole, the group saw an approaching army&mdash;figures in crimson armor and orcish soldiers advancing through the dust.</li>
	<li>Olek warned the others: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s kind of an army coming toward us.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Olek, realizing the danger, shouted for Kaedin to &ldquo;put the stones back&rdquo; and close the breach, hoping to fortify their position.</li>
	<li>Bonnie questioned the ritualist woman at the artifact&rsquo;s center, asking if the incoming army were her allies. The woman ignored her, focused entirely on the unstable magic.</li>
	<li>With no assistance coming, the group prepared for a defensive stand.</li>
	<li>Bonnie reacted first, casting Fairy Fire over a cluster of red-armored enemies, marking them as glowing targets.</li>
	<li>Seeing no escape, Bonnie then hid, disappearing into the chaos.</li>
	<li>Olek attempted to call upon divine power but found his connection severed by the artifact&rsquo;s corruption.</li>
	<li>Undeterred, he fought on through martial skill alone, striking the first enemy through the breach.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Chaotic Barrage</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>As the battle intensified, Norr&rsquo;s Wild Magic surged uncontrollably, triggering a Fireball centered on her position.</li>
	<li>The blast severely injured her and Soshi but incinerated six enemies, devastating the front line.</li>
	<li>The room filled with smoke, ozone, and burnt flesh &mdash; proof of Norr&rsquo;s raw but volatile strength.</li>
	<li>Enemy archers fired volleys into the chamber, destroying Kaedin&rsquo;s echo and pelting Olek, though his armor absorbed most hits.</li>
	<li>The main force&mdash;a mix of orcs and disciplined soldiers&mdash;charged the breach, overwhelming Olek and Kaedin&rsquo;s defensive line.</li>
	<li>Both were knocked prone by a massive orc&rsquo;s charge.</li>
	<li>Norr retaliated with Lightning Bolt, electrocuting seven orcs in a line.</li>
	<li>The bolt also struck one of Soshi&rsquo;s magical cats, which absorbed the energy and gained a temporary shield.</li>
	<li>Soshi threw two metallic spheres that released additional spectral cats, joining the fight.</li>
	<li>From her invisible vantage point, Bonnie loosed an arrow into one of the dragonkin commanders, injuring it severely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Turning of the Tide</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The battlefield became a chaotic mix of spellfire, steel, and summoned familiars.</li>
	<li>Kaedin, disoriented, experienced a mental split between himself and his echo but managed to command it effectively, killing a weakened orc.</li>
	<li>Archers redirected their fire toward the spectral cats; Olek&rsquo;s feline companion was injured but fought on.</li>
	<li>Olek recovered, retreating slightly under heavy blows to target the dragonkin who had trapped his cat in a magical sphere.</li>
	<li>With a powerful warhammer strike, Olek broke the creature&rsquo;s concentration, freeing the cat.</li>
	<li>The feline immediately leapt back into battle, slashing its former captor under Olek&rsquo;s command.</li>
	<li>Soshi directed her cats to harass the archers while launching acidic blasts that melted soldier armor.</li>
	<li>Bonnie, still under Greater Invisibility, teleported behind the second dragonkin leader using her medallion&rsquo;s power, and then continued with her movement.</li>
	<li>Her dual strikes were lethal: the first inflicted massive bleeding, and the second killed one of the shaman&rsquo;s outright, collapsing it onto the stone floor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Artifact&rsquo;s Last Gasp</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>With the ritualist slain, the artifact destabilized&mdash;emitting a wave of necrotic energy across the chamber.</li>
	<li>The pulse weakened casters and familiars but was partially resisted by Olek and Kaedin.</li>
	<li>The artifact began spinning violently, glowing brighter as it prepared to explode.</li>
	<li>The group had only seconds to act; they took cover or braced for impact.</li>
	<li>The explosion was blinding and deafening, obliterating the chamber and hurling the party into darkness.</li>
	<li>Their consciousnesses were torn from their bodies&mdash;each thrown into individual prophetic visions of a ruined future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Olek &amp; Norr &ndash; The Blighted Fortress</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Found themselves in a corrupted Paladin stronghold overrun by crystalline blight.</li>
	<li>The fortress commander was impaled and mutating but still conscious.</li>
	<li>He revealed that Lamashtu&rsquo;s cults infiltrated the order after the Battle for Bremen, when recruitment standards faltered.</li>
	<li>The fortress fell due to an Angevin fleet landing unexpectedly, alongside their resurrected god, Kresimir.</li>
	<li>The commander died mid-sentence; the vision shattered.</li>
	<li>Norr later noted her future self had lost her right arm.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kaedin &ndash; The Burning Village</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Witnessed his neighboring village engulfed in flames.</li>
	<li>Rescued two children trapped under rubble who spoke of the Blue Bear sigil leading the attack.</li>
	<li>The children revealed that slavers and cultists had taken villagers for ritual sacrifice.</li>
	<li>Their next target: Kaedin&rsquo;s own home village.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bonnie &ndash; The Fall of the Feywild</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Rode her rat familiar, Jacques, amid a catastrophic Feywild war.</li>
	<li>Saw Titania and the Queen of Air and Darkness fighting side by side against a lone warrior wielding energy spears.</li>
	<li>She asked who are they fighting and the queens replied &ldquo;kilgor and his army&rdquo;</li>
	<li>The Fey Courts of Spring and Autumn were annihilated; chromatic dragons decimated the skies.</li>
	<li>The last line of defense was some paladins unknown to her, later revealed at the 9 from neverwinter.</li>
	<li>The enemy banners included the Red Hand, Black Orcs, and the Blue Bear sigil.</li>
	<li>The mysterious warrior seized their crowns&mdash;signaling the withering of the Feywild.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Soshi &ndash; The Siege of Neverwinter</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Found herself chained among hundreds of prisoners at a siege encampment before Neverwinter&rsquo;s walls.</li>
	<li>Red Wizards of Thay led the assault, using prisoners&rsquo; life force to fuel a massive ritual.</li>
	<li>Overhead flew chromatic dragons, while Arcane Brotherhood mages and Blue Bear banners commanded the army.</li>
	<li>The ritual&rsquo;s purpose: destroy Neverwinter&rsquo;s walls through mass sacrifice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aftermath and a New Path</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The explosion subsided, leaving the chamber in ruins and the artifact shattered.</li>
	<li>The oppressive corruption was gone; the air felt clean but heavy with aftermath.</li>
	<li>The party recovered amid the debris, reunited with their now-mundane feline companions.</li>
	<li>They discussed their visions, identifying recurring elements:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The Blue Bear sigil as a unifying banner.</li>
		<li>Alliances between the Red Hand, Arcane Brotherhood, chromatic dragons, and Lamashtu cults.</li>
		<li>The Battle for Bremen as a pivotal defeat leading to widespread corruption.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Determined to prevent this future, they resolved to act quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Yoghurt&rsquo;s Return</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>As they exited the ruined fortress, Yoghurt, the friendly ninja-ogre, reappeared.</li>
	<li>He dragged two corpses of cloaked infiltrators who had been spying near the exit.</li>
	<li>Their bodies showed the same black-veined corruption seen in Olek&rsquo;s vision.</li>
	<li>Bonnie investigated&mdash;no identifying items except foreign-made gear.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Warning to Drellin&rsquo;s Ferry</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Recognizing the urgency, Bonnie wrote a detailed letter to Captain Soranna in Drellin&rsquo;s Ferry.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Warnings: approaching army (ETA four days), visions, unified enemy forces, and untrustworthiness of the Arcane Brotherhood.</li>
		<li>Objective: immediate evacuation or reinforcement.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>She entrusted the letter to Yoghurt, paying him 3 gold pieces and giving strict instructions:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Deliver only to Soranna.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Do not show it to Cat.&rdquo;</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Yoghurt repeated the message, nodded solemnly, and disappeared into the woods to deliver it.</li>
</ul>
