<p><strong>The Onslaught Begins</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The session opened immediately after the explosion that breached the ritual chamber wall.</li>
<li>Through the hole, the group saw an <strong>approaching army</strong>&mdash;figures in crimson armor and orcish soldiers advancing through the dust.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Olek] warned the others: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s kind of an army coming toward us.&rdquo;</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Olek], realizing the danger, shouted for [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] to &ldquo;put the stones back&rdquo; and close the breach, hoping to fortify their position.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] questioned the <strong>ritualist woman</strong> at the artifact&rsquo;s center, asking if the incoming army were her allies. The woman ignored her, focused entirely on the unstable magic.</li>
<li>With no assistance coming, the group prepared for a defensive stand.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] reacted first, casting <strong>Fairy Fire</strong> over a cluster of red-armored enemies, marking them as glowing targets.</li>
<li>Seeing no escape, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] then hid, disappearing into the chaos.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Olek] attempted to call upon divine power but found his connection severed by the artifact&rsquo;s corruption.</li>
<li>Undeterred, he fought on through martial skill alone, striking the first enemy through the breach.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Chaotic Barrage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As the battle intensified, <strong>[ENTITY:character:Norr]&rsquo;s Wild Magic</strong> surged uncontrollably, triggering a <strong>Fireball</strong> centered on her position.</li>
<li>The blast severely injured her and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] but incinerated six enemies, devastating the front line.</li>
<li>The room filled with smoke, ozone, and burnt flesh &mdash; proof of [ENTITY:character:Norr]&rsquo;s raw but volatile strength.</li>
<li>Enemy archers fired volleys into the chamber, destroying [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]&rsquo;s echo and pelting [ENTITY:character:Olek], though his armor absorbed most hits.</li>
<li>The main force&mdash;a mix of orcs and disciplined soldiers&mdash;charged the breach, overwhelming [ENTITY:character:Olek] and [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]&rsquo;s defensive line.</li>
<li>Both were knocked prone by a massive orc&rsquo;s charge.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Norr] retaliated with <strong>Lightning Bolt</strong>, electrocuting seven orcs in a line.</li>
<li>The bolt also struck one of [ENTITY:character:Soshi]&rsquo;s <strong>magical cats</strong>, which absorbed the energy and gained a temporary shield.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Soshi] threw two metallic spheres that released <strong>additional spectral cats</strong>, joining the fight.</li>
<li>From her invisible vantage point, <strong>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie]</strong> loosed an arrow into one of the <strong>dragonkin commanders</strong>, injuring it severely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Turning of the Tide</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The battlefield became a chaotic mix of spellfire, steel, and summoned familiars.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin], disoriented, experienced a mental split between himself and his echo but managed to command it effectively, killing a weakened orc.</li>
<li>Archers redirected their fire toward the spectral cats; [ENTITY:character:Olek]&rsquo;s feline companion was injured but fought on.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Olek] recovered, retreating slightly under heavy blows to target the dragonkin who had trapped his cat in a magical sphere.</li>
<li>With a powerful <strong>warhammer strike</strong>, [ENTITY:character:Olek] broke the creature&rsquo;s concentration, freeing the cat.</li>
<li>The feline immediately leapt back into battle, slashing its former captor under [ENTITY:character:Olek]&rsquo;s command.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Soshi] directed her cats to harass the archers while launching <strong>acidic blasts</strong> that melted soldier armor.</li>
<li><strong>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie]</strong>, still under Greater Invisibility, <strong>teleported</strong> behind the second dragonkin leader using her medallion&rsquo;s power, and then continued with her movement.</li>
<li>Her <strong>dual strikes</strong> were lethal: the first inflicted massive bleeding, and the second killed one of the shaman&rsquo;s outright, collapsing it onto the stone floor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Artifact&rsquo;s Last Gasp</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With the ritualist slain, the <strong>artifact destabilized</strong>&mdash;emitting a wave of necrotic energy across the chamber.</li>
<li>The pulse weakened casters and familiars but was partially resisted by [ENTITY:character:Olek] and [ENTITY:character:Kaedin].</li>
<li>The artifact began spinning violently, glowing brighter as it prepared to explode.</li>
<li>The group had only seconds to act; they took cover or braced for impact.</li>
<li>The explosion was blinding and deafening, obliterating the chamber and hurling the party into darkness.</li>
<li>Their consciousnesses were torn from their bodies&mdash;each thrown into <strong>individual prophetic visions</strong> of a ruined future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visions of a Fractured Future</strong></p>
<p><strong>[ENTITY:character:Olek] &amp; [ENTITY:character:Norr] &ndash; The Blighted Fortress</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Found themselves in a corrupted [ENTITY:class:Paladin] stronghold overrun by crystalline blight.</li>
<li>The fortress commander was impaled and mutating but still conscious.</li>
<li>He revealed that <strong>Lamashtu&rsquo;s cults</strong> infiltrated the order after the <strong>Battle for Bremen</strong>, when recruitment standards faltered.</li>
<li>The fortress fell due to an <strong>Angevin fleet</strong> landing unexpectedly, alongside their <strong>resurrected god, Kresimir</strong>.</li>
<li>The commander died mid-sentence; the vision shattered.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Norr] later noted her future self had <strong>lost her right arm</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] &ndash; The Burning Village</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Witnessed his neighboring village engulfed in flames.</li>
<li>Rescued two children trapped under rubble who spoke of the <strong>Blue Bear sigil</strong> leading the attack.</li>
<li>The children revealed that <strong>slavers and cultists</strong> had taken villagers for ritual sacrifice.</li>
<li>Their next target: [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]&rsquo;s own home village.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] &ndash; The Fall of the Feywild</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rode her rat familiar, <strong>[ENTITY:npc:Jacques]</strong>, amid a catastrophic Feywild war.</li>
<li>Saw <strong>Titania</strong> and the <strong>Queen of Air and Darkness</strong> fighting side by side against a lone warrior wielding <strong>energy spears</strong>.</li>
<li>She asked who are they fighting and the queens replied &ldquo;kilgor and his army&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Fey Courts of Spring and Autumn were annihilated; chromatic dragons decimated the skies.</li>
<li>The last line of defense was some paladins unknown to her, later revealed at the 9 from Neverwinter.</li>
<li>The enemy banners included the <strong>Red Hand</strong>, <strong>Black Orcs</strong>, and the <strong>Blue Bear sigil</strong>.</li>
<li>The mysterious warrior seized their crowns&mdash;signaling the <strong>withering of the Feywild</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[ENTITY:character:Soshi] &ndash; The Siege of Neverwinter</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Found herself chained among hundreds of prisoners at a <strong>siege encampment</strong> before Neverwinter&rsquo;s walls.</li>
<li><strong>Red Wizards of Thay</strong> led the assault, using prisoners&rsquo; life force to fuel a massive ritual.</li>
<li>Overhead flew <strong>chromatic dragons</strong>, while <strong>[ENTITY:guild:Arcane Brotherhood]</strong> mages and <strong>Blue Bear</strong> banners commanded the army.</li>
<li>The ritual&rsquo;s purpose: destroy Neverwinter&rsquo;s walls through mass sacrifice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aftermath and a New Path</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The explosion subsided, leaving the chamber in ruins and the <strong>artifact shattered</strong>.</li>
<li>The oppressive corruption was gone; the air felt clean but heavy with aftermath.</li>
<li>The party recovered amid the debris, reunited with their now-mundane <strong>feline companions</strong>.</li>
<li>They discussed their visions, identifying recurring elements:</li>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Blue Bear sigil</strong> as a unifying banner.</li>
<li>Alliances between the <strong>Red Hand</strong>, <strong>[ENTITY:guild:Arcane Brotherhood]</strong>, <strong>chromatic dragons</strong>, and <strong>Lamashtu cults</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Battle for Bremen</strong> as a pivotal defeat leading to widespread corruption.</li>
</ul>
<li>Determined to prevent this future, they resolved to act quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[ENTITY:npc:Yoghurt]&rsquo;s Return</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As they exited the ruined fortress, <strong>[ENTITY:npc:Yoghurt]</strong>, the friendly ninja-ogre, reappeared.</li>
<li>He dragged two corpses of <strong>cloaked infiltrators</strong> who had been spying near the exit.</li>
<li>Their bodies showed the same <strong>black-veined corruption</strong> seen in [ENTITY:character:Olek]&rsquo;s vision.</li>
<li>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] investigated&mdash;no identifying items except foreign-made gear.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Warning to Drellin&rsquo;s Ferry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recognizing the urgency, <strong>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] wrote a detailed letter</strong> to <strong>Captain [ENTITY:npc:Soranna]</strong> in Drellin&rsquo;s Ferry.</li>
<ul>
<li>Warnings: approaching army (ETA four days), visions, unified enemy forces, and untrustworthiness of the [ENTITY:guild:Arcane Brotherhood].</li>
<li>Objective: immediate evacuation or reinforcement.</li>
</ul>
<li>She entrusted the letter to [ENTITY:npc:Yoghurt], paying him <strong>3 gold pieces</strong> and giving strict instructions:</li>
<ul>
<li>Deliver <strong>only to [ENTITY:npc:Soranna]</strong>.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Do not show it to Cat.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<li>[ENTITY:npc:Yoghurt] repeated the message, nodded solemnly, and disappeared into the woods to deliver it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Session End</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The group stood amidst the wreckage, aware the real war had only just begun.</li>
<li>Their next mission was clear: <strong>reach and destroy the bridge</strong> to delay the enemy army&rsquo;s advance.</li>
<li>With renewed determination&mdash;and the burden of their visions&mdash;they departed the fortress to face the coming storm.</li>
</ul>
