<h3>The Leviathan's Hall</h3>

<p>The party’s ascent from the subterranean hell of the caves had been a desperate, gasping scramble for life. They emerged into the world above only to find themselves adrift on a strange ship in an unknown sea. Their salvation, such as it was, came not as a gentle hand but as a grappling hook. A colossal vessel, all black wood and green-tinged sails, bore down on them. Its name was visible even from a distance: The Leviathan’s Hall.</p>

<p>As their small craft was pulled alongside the massive warship, pirates swarmed the deck, their voices rough and jeering. "We got some plunder!" one shouted, as the party—[ENTITY:character:Bonnie], [ENTITY:character:Kaedin], [ENTITY:character:Soshi], and [ENTITY:character:Norr]—were hauled unceremoniously onto the deck. [ENTITY:character:Olek], their stoic companion, assisted his friends, his divine aura dimmed by exhaustion and the pungent salt spray.</p>

<p>They were prodded toward the helm, where two figures stood observing them, silhouetted against the waning light. The first was a man of terrifying proportions, standing nearly seven feet tall. His weathered bronze skin was a canvas of glistening, ink-black tattoos. He was bare-chested, wearing only a heavy, open coat of what looked like wyvern hide, dyed a deep kelp green and studded with barnacle-like iron rivets. The coat’s interior shimmered with the iridescent scales of some deep-sea serpent, and as he moved, it seemed to flow like liquid night. A scent of sharp brine and old blood wafted from him.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi]’s arcane knowledge prickled. The tattoos were not mere decoration; they were the ritualistic markings of Sahuagin shamans. A coiling kraken wrapped down his arm, its ink seeming to slither slowly on his skin. He wore a belt of braided sea snakes, a pair of throwing axes, and boots of manta ray hide. Around his neck hung a compass that appeared broken, its needle spinning wildly before stopping, pointing at [ENTITY:character:Soshi], and then spinning again.</p>

<p>But it was the cutlass at his hip that made [ENTITY:character:Soshi]’s blood run cold. She recognized it instantly—a relic stolen from the Brotherhood’s treasury five years prior. It was the Breaker of Hulls, its blade curved like a shark’s tooth and glowing with faint blue runes. Runes, she knew, that flared to life when drawn against a traitor.</p>

<p>The second figure, a woman, glided across the deck with the grace of a phantom. She wore a regal, high-collared garment of night-blue velvet, stitched with silver thread in patterns resembling constellations and maelstroms. Form-fitting black leather trousers were tucked into boots inlaid with sapphires that flashed like bioluminescent plankton. Her corset was a mosaic of polished abalone shell, and a half-cloak of shimmering mist floated behind her, never quite touching the ground. Her pale skin seemed almost luminescent, a clear sign of her Fey-touched blood. Her eyes were a piercing, crystalline blue, laced with veins of lightning that flickered with latent power.</p>

<p>As she approached, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] felt the distinct thrum of magic being cast. Instinctively, she threw up a hand, weaving a counter-spell that shattered the woman's subtle probe. The woman’s eyes snapped to [ENTITY:character:Soshi], a flicker of surprise in their electric depths.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi]’s gaze dropped to the woman’s hands, where rings adorned each finger. Her sharp mind identified the sigils: each ring represented a different school of magic. At the woman's hip hung another stolen treasure, a delicately carved blade that [ENTITY:character:Soshi] also recognized from the Brotherhood's museum: Winder, crafted from a shard of storm-forged glass, humming with latent thunder.</p>

<p>The towering man’s voice rumbled like distant thunder. "Please, bring our... esteemed guests... to the bridge."</p>

<h3>A Queen's Plea & A Pirate's Price</h3>

<p>The party was ushered before the two commanders. "How did you end up in the mountains with your ship?" the man asked.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi], taking the lead, quickly explained. "It's not our ship. We found it and escaped... the caves. A hellish place." She recounted the runes, the monsters, the collapsing tunnels, and the monsters they had faced, including the hydra.</p>

<p>"The Sword Coast," [ENTITY:character:Soshi] said, trying to orient them. "The closest city with a dry dock is [ENTITY:location:Brindol]."</p>

<p>The pirates seemed confused by this. "Where is Nautica on your map?" the woman, Bianca, asked.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi] knew the name. "It's a pirate archipelago," she explained, "but it's not on this coast. It's far to the south, across the Shining Sea."</p>

<p>The two commanders exchanged a look. They were hopelessly lost.</p>

<p>"Well," Turiados said, his voice hardening, "we require a fee for saving you from that ship."</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie], never one to be intimidated, zipped forward. "We didn't ask you to save us! We didn't need your 'save.' We are strong, independent people!"</p>

<p>Turiados merely raised an eyebrow. "You have a very strong mouth for someone in your current position. It does not scare me. I've been through worse."</p>

<p>"Maybe we could introduce each other," [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] chirped, changing tactics.</p>

<p>"I am Commander Turiados," the man rumbled. "Formerly of the Order of Inos, currently commander of the Leviathan's Hall."</p>

<p>The woman stepped forward, her fey-touched aura flaring with intensity. "And I am Commander Bianca, House Corina. Last descendant and true Queen of Pelagos." Her voice, though melodic, was laced with steel. "And I swear I will get my throne back, one way or another. The tyrant king will die."</p>

<p>As she spoke, the entire crew erupted in a unified shout.</p>

<p>"Who is this tyrant king?" [ENTITY:character:Norr] asked, her curiosity piqued.</p>

<p>"An evil necromancer," Bianca spat. "He came from nowhere, killed my father, and stole my throne. His name is Sandro."</p>

<p>She went on to explain their plight. They were from another continent, Lustria. They had been fighting a war with lizardfolk when a sudden, cataclysmic event—the regrowth of the deep jungles—caused the lizardfolk to inexplicably retreat. With no external enemy, the great houses of Pelagos turned on each other, plunging the realm into civil war, allowing Sandro to seize power.</p>

<p>The party was dismissed, the pirates leaving them to "find their bearings" and consider the 20% rescue fee. As they were led away, [ENTITY:character:Soshi]’s keen ears caught Bianca’s quiet, frustrated sigh to Turiados.</p>

<p>"I do wish he was here," she murmured. "He would know what to do."</p>

<h3>Whispers on the Deck</h3>

<p>The party split up to explore the upper deck, a strange and dangerous menagerie. The crew was a motley collection of races from all corners of the world: minotaurs polished cannons, a turbaned Efreeti happily stoked the ship’s forge, and troglodytes skittered from below deck. Their two mercenary acquaintances, [ENTITY:npc:Vandal] and Scoundrel, were tied up near the mast. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] flew over and sent them a quick, telepathic message.</p>

<p>Are you okay? Do you need help?</p>

<p>[ENTITY:npc:Vandal]’s mental voice was grim. We’re fine. We agreed to pay the rescue fee. We won’t get far from these people. Don’t try anything stupid.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie], deciding that gathering information was not stupid, zipped over to a peg-legged pirate who was drinking from a bizarre mug that seemed to be alive, its tentacles wrapped around his wrist to prevent spills.</p>

<p>"Now that is a very cool mug," [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] said, striking up a conversation.</p>

<p>The pirate, who introduced himself as Marise Curs, was happy to talk. He boasted of their recent plunder, confirming they had raided three trader vessels from [ENTITY:location:Brindol]. "The captain, her ship, her crew," he said with drunken pride. "A thousand voices, we fight in her name. We are bound by blood to her family."</p>

<p>"All of you?" [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] asked, gesturing to the minotaurs and the Efreeti.</p>

<p>"Even the least of us," Marise slurred.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie], ever the rogue, pressed for more. "You all seem very loyal. But who was this 'Lee' the captain was sad about?"</p>

<p>Marise’s face darkened. "General Lee. A former convict, like many of us. We were all slaves in the penal colony, mining ore. Lee... he was the commander of the mercenaries who broke us out. He sent us to recover a ship, which Bianca... well, she took it."</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] traded the pirate a small, tinkling bell from the Feylands for a pirate-themed bandana, mulling over this new information. Meanwhile, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] approached the forge, where the Efreeti and a heavily augmented dwarf named Bardin Cratcho were tempering runes onto a batch of cutlasses.</p>

<p>"Pardon, friend," [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] said, his deep voice respectful. "Could you put one of those runes on this short sword?"</p>

<p>Bardin glared at him. "I can. How much are you willing to pay? Fifty gold pieces."</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] balked at the price. "You must be lying. A rune can't cost that much."</p>

<p>The dwarf roared with laughter, his beard singed by the heat. "Lying? I ate a batch of molten slag to prove to everyone that my forge is up to par! My skills are worth more than you can afford, boy."</p>

<p>Across the deck, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] was formulating a dangerous plan. She knew the mountains near [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry] were crawling with orcs and goblins—the very enemies they were trying to stop. She also knew her personal quest to retrieve a pair of magical boots led to a necromancer’s tower in that same region. If she could convince these pirates that vast, unguarded "treasure" waited for them in those mountains, she could potentially trick them into clearing out the orc fortress and get a free ride to her objective.</p>

<p>She also spoke briefly to a massive Ice Elemental named Glass, who appeared to be one of Bianca’s chief advisors. His voice was the sound of cracking glaciers, and he spoke with agonizing slowness. It took him five full minutes just to say "Hello." He confirmed his loyalty, explaining that Bianca had freed him from shackles, and he had, in turn, pledged his "blood loyalty" to her.</p>

<h3>The Negotiation</h3>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi] noticed the ship was heading north, sailing parallel to the coast but steadily moving away from [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry] and the river they needed to take. "We have to talk to them," she urged, and the party—[ENTITY:character:Bonnie], [ENTITY:character:Soshi], and [ENTITY:character:Norr]—approached the two commanders at the helm.</p>

<p>As they drew near, Turiados’s strange, spinning compass went still, its needle pointing directly at [ENTITY:character:Soshi].</p>

<p>"I keep this funny trinket," Turiados rumbled, noticing her gaze. "It links me with the person I’m looking at and points to the direction of their greatest desire."</p>

<p>"I have no idea what you're talking about," [ENTITY:character:Soshi] said, her face an impassive mask, even as her mind raced. He knows. He knows I want to find the portal home.</p>

<p>"Can I borrow it for a while?" she asked, feigning innocence. "I just need to find the portal back home."</p>

<p>Before Turiados could answer, the Ice Elemental, Glass, materialized beside them. His voice was no longer slow; it was crisp, cold, and sharp. He was all business.</p>

<p>"I am the ship’s Quartermaster and negotiator," Glass stated. "As such, I am here to assess your current belongings and take the fair due for rescuing you." He looked directly at [ENTITY:character:Soshi]. "I see a renowned sword-master," he said, nodding to [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]. "And by the way you resisted my probe, a member of the esteemed school in Lustria. A spell-breaker."</p>

<p>Bianca’s lightning-veined eyes narrowed. "What's a member of the Brotherhood doing so far lost?" she asked [ENTITY:character:Soshi] directly.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi] deflected. "It's... not your business to know."</p>

<p>While Bianca’s attention was fixed on [ENTITY:character:Soshi], [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] engaged Turiados about the compass. "What would you want for that trinket?"</p>

<p>"I can make a deal," Turiados said, a predatory glint in his eye. "There is a necromancer whose lands I would like... cleansed. His name is Sandro."</p>

<p>The party froze. "Sandro?" [ENTITY:character:Norr] repeated. "We know that name."</p>

<p>"He turned an entire village in Lustria into zombies," Turiados growled. "I know he got to this side of the world, but I don't have time to chase him. Bring me a locket of his hair, and the compass is yours." He tossed [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] a small, intricately carved whistle. "When you find him, whistle this. It will point the way."</p>

<p>As Bianca and Glass moved to discuss the 20% fee, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] pulled them aside. "Let's say," she whispered, "one might have touched something... that might be cursed. In the form of a pirate coin."</p>

<p>Glass’s icy form seemed to stiffen. "A sort of cursed currency. Yes, I know of it. Congratulations. Then you can keep it all. We don't want it spreading to our crew."</p>

<p>The elemental explained the curse. The coins had infected all of the party's gold, transforming their entire savings into a pouch of near-worthless copper. The value could change daily, but for now, they were destitute.</p>

<p>"We take 20% of what you do have," Glass declared. The party members glumly presented their gear. The pirates took [ENTITY:character:Olek]’s javelins, [ENTITY:character:Norr]’s climbing rope, and eight of their precious pearls. As they sorted the items, Bianca’s eyes fell on [ENTITY:character:Norr]’s Fey-touched makeup kit.</p>

<p>"I am willing to give you a dress or a piece of armor for that makeup kit," Bianca offered.</p>

<p>"Nope," [ENTITY:character:Norr] said flatly.</p>

<p>As the party gathered their remaining belongings, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] decided to try one last bit of pixie mischief. With a flick of her wrist, she attempted to slyly drop one of her cursed coins onto the deck, a parting gift for the pirates.</p>

<p>She was not fast enough. Bianca, who had been watching her with the intensity of a hawk, reacted instantly. "Try that again," she hissed. A bolt of pure, crackling force erupted from her outstretched hand, slamming into [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] and sending her tumbling to the deck, her entire body aching from the impact.</p>

<p>Turiados merely grunted. "Row them to shore."</p>

<h3>Stranded</h3>

<p>The party, along with the two mercenaries, [ENTITY:npc:Vandal] and Scoundrel, were unceremoniously dumped in a rowboat and left on a rocky, desolate beach. Tall, ancient trees pressed right up to the shoreline. It was nearly 6 PM, and the sun was beginning to dip below the horizon.</p>

<p>"Well, we've had enough of this fucking place," [ENTITY:npc:Vandal] spat, rubbing his chafed wrists. "Those fuckers! 'Saving us.' We have gills! We could have swum!"</p>

<p>"At least on land, we have a chance to fight back," Scoundrel added.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] chirped, trying to lighten the mood. "They have no idea where they're going. They'll die on the way."</p>

<p>"I hope so," [ENTITY:npc:Vandal] grumbled. "Or I hope they meet the other pirates. The ones that don't die."</p>

<p>"Undead pirates?" [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]’s eyes went wide with excitement. "Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere they want to be," [ENTITY:npc:Vandal] said. He let out a sharp whistle. Two massive, crocodile-like mounts emerged from the trees. The mercenaries mounted up. "We'll be heading north. Good luck."</p>

<p>As they rode off into the shallows, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] cupped her hands and shouted after them, "By the way, there's a necromancer named Sandro roaming the roads here! Be careful!"</p>

<p>The party was alone. [ENTITY:character:Soshi] confirmed their location: they were a good six or seven-hour march from [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry]. Traveling in the dark forest was too dangerous. With a near-perfect survival check, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] located a small, defensible cave in the rocky cliffs overlooking the beach, hidden by overgrown vines.</p>

<p>As the others settled in, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] got to work. "Just a moment," she announced, and spent twenty minutes meticulously setting two bear traps at the mouth of the cave, hidden beneath leaves and sand.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie], with her fey nature, took the first watch. Hours passed in silence, broken only by the rhythmic crash of waves. Then, near 1 AM, she heard it: a loud CLANK followed by a piercing shriek. She sent her familiar, Jac, to investigate. The tiny, rat-like creature returned moments later, its fur matted with blood and feathers. A giant, vicious-looking seagull lay dead in the jaws of her trap.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi] took the second watch. In the pale moonlight, she watched as a skittering army of large crabs emerged from the surf. They swarmed the dead seagull, and within an hour, had picked the carcass clean, leaving nothing but scattered bones before retreating back to the sea. [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] took the final watch until dawn, which passed without incident.</p>

<h3>Ambush in the Oaks</h3>

<p>The party awoke, stiff and sore. The first order of business was [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]'s cursed gold. She checked the pouch, hoping for a miracle. The DM rolled. A 70. The coins remained stubbornly copper.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi] and [ENTITY:character:Norr], both Eladrin, felt the shift of the new day. The magic of the Summer court flowed through them, making them feel supportive and strong, but also impatient and quick to action—a volatile combination.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin], his survival instincts sharp, took the lead. They set off at a steady pace, leaving the beach and entering the dense oak forest. They walked for nearly six hours, the ancient trees creating large, sun-dappled clearings.</p>

<p>In one such clearing, they spotted a group of otters playing in a brook. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], delighted, decided to sneak closer. Her pixie form was utterly silent as she flitted from shadow to shadow.</p>

<p>It was this very silence that saved her. As she neared the brook, a blur of motion exploded from the canopy above. A massive, pouched beast with a powerfully built body and terrifying jaws—a Thylacoleo—pounced from a high branch, aiming for the spot [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] had just vacated. The ambush had failed, but the fight had just begun.</p>

<p>Two more of the beasts dropped from the trees, their spotted pelts blending with the dappled light. The party found themselves surrounded.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie], reacting with supernatural speed, was the first to act. She blurred forward, her blade already alight with fey fire, and sank it deep into the first beast. She channeled her power into the strike, and the creature roared as magical flames seared its flesh.</p>

<p>The second Thylacoleo, moving with terrifying speed, bounded toward [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]. It raked him with its claws, then clamped its powerful jaws onto his arm, its momentum carrying both of them backward. The third beast, the largest of the three, targeted [ENTITY:character:Soshi]. It leaped, catching her with its full weight, and with an incredible display of strength, scrambled back up the tree trunk, carrying the wizard in its vise-like grip.</p>

<p>"[ENTITY:character:Soshi]!" [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] yelled, as he, too, was hit again by the beast attacking him.</p>

<p>High in the branches, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] found herself pinned and restrained. Below, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] manifested his Echo, a ghostly double of himself, which immediately engaged the Thylacoleo attacking its creator. The Echo’s blade struck true, and the creature recoiled, a deep, bleeding gash opening on its flank.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie], seeing [ENTITY:character:Soshi] in peril, didn't hesitate. She dashed to the base of the tree, sprang into the air, and drove her short sword into the creature holding the wizard. The blade bit deep, a perfect sneak attack, and the beast shrieked, its grip faltering.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi] seized the opportunity. Gathering her will, she muttered a single word and vanished in a puff of silvery mist. She reappeared on the forest floor thirty feet below, stumbling but free. As she landed, she cast Mirror Image, and three illusory copies of herself flickered into existence around her.</p>

<p>The first beast, already wounded by [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], succumbed to its injuries and collapsed. But the fight was far from over. The Thylacoleo that had been fighting [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]’s Echo abandoned the phantom, leaped past [ENTITY:character:Kaedin], and clamped its jaws onto his leg. In one powerful motion, it, too, bounded up a tree, dragging the heavy Genasi with it.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin], now dangling precariously, cursed and tried to break the creature's iron grip, but failed. Thinking quickly, he used his [ENTITY:subclass:Echo Knight] ability, transposing himself with his Echo on the ground, and reappeared, free from the grapple. From the forest floor, he commanded his Echo—still adjacent to the beast in the tree—to strike again, slicing into its hide.</p>

<p>At the same time, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] saw [ENTITY:character:Norr] struggling to find a clear shot. "[ENTITY:character:Norr]! Hold still!" [ENTITY:character:Soshi] shouted, and unleashed the full power of a Polymorph spell. [ENTITY:character:Norr]’s form wavered and swelled, her elven features melting away as she erupted into the shape of a Giant Ape.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie], seeing the second beast still in the tree, took a running start. She Misty Stepped, teleporting in a flash of blue light directly onto the branch beside it. She unleashed a flurry of attacks, her blades a silver blur, and the beast, mortally wounded, fell crashing to the ground. As she landed, she quickly downed a healing potion, the world steadying around her.</p>

<p>The last Thylacoleo, seeing the new, massive ape, pounced. It slammed into Giant-Ape-[ENTITY:character:Norr], its claws digging deep and making the ape bleed.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi], seeing the creature’s hide had absorbed [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]'s fey fire, opted for a different approach. She unleashed a Scorching Ray, sending three bolts of pure fire searing into the beast. Its fur was instantly incinerated, but the flames seemed to gutter and die against its thick skin, doing less damage than she’d hoped.</p>

<p>Enraged, Giant-Ape-[ENTITY:character:Norr] beat its chest and retaliated, pummeling the Thylacoleo with two massive fists. The creature staggered, badly wounded. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] zipped in one last time, her dagger finding its mark, and the final beast fell silent.</p>

<h3>The Spoils</h3>

<p>The clearing was quiet, save for the party’s heavy breathing. [ENTITY:character:Norr] shifted back to her Eladrin form, rubbing her shoulders. The Giant Ape form had taken the brunt of the damage.</p>

<p>"Well," [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] panted, wiping her blade. "That was something."</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin], ever the practical one, retrieved his javelins and began the grim task of skinning the creatures. The hide was thick and strangely resilient. With his survival expertise, he managed to salvage three intact pelts and half a dozen sharp fangs.</p>

<p>As he worked, a new sound reached their ears—a faint, pitiful meowing.</p>

<p>"Kittens?" [ENTITY:character:Norr] whispered.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie]’s perception was sharp. She looked up, scanning the branches. "Up there!" She flew up to the tree the largest beast had fallen from and found a hollow in the trunk. Tucked inside were seven small, spotted, impossibly cute Thylacoleo cubs, their eyes barely open.</p>

<p>The party’s resolve melted. "We can't just leave them," [ENTITY:character:Soshi] said, her voice soft.</p>

<p>"We can take them to [ENTITY:npc:Avarthel]," [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] suggested. "The druid will know what to do."</p>

<p>They bundled the cubs, using [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]’s tattered leather to fashion a makeshift sling. They were weak with hunger, and they turned their noses up at the party's watered-down rations.</p>

<h3>The Wizard and the Menagerie</h3>

<p>The party finally reached the outskirts of Drellin’s Ferry. They made their way directly to the druid’s grove, but [ENTITY:npc:Avarthel] was nowhere to be found. Only his giant snake guardian was present, and it eyed the cubs with a predatory hunger that made the party back away slowly.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Norr] headed to the church, hoping to find someone who knew where the druid had gone. She found a dour cleric, Brother Danny, who informed her that [ENTITY:npc:Avarthel] and his followers had left for the mountains a month ago and would not return. When [ENTITY:character:Norr] pleaded for help with the "kittens," the cleric was unsympathetic.</p>

<p>Desperate, [ENTITY:character:Norr] ran back into the street, where she spotted a local goat-herd. She pressed a gold coin into his hand—a massive overpayment—and begged him for milk. The bewildered farmer, seeing her distress, ran to his home and returned not just with 5 liters, but 10 more, his entire stock.</p>

<p>They fed the hungry cubs, who drank greedily. As the tiny creatures settled, their bellies full, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] had an idea.</p>

<p>"I'll be right back," she said, and zipped off toward the wizard Sertieren’s mansion.</p>

<p>She found the old mage on his porch. "Good afternoon, sir," she chirped. "We haven't met. I'm [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]."</p>

<p>Sertieren smiled. "I know of you." He offered her tea, a rare blend from the Summer Court that tasted like home. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] explained her fey heritage, how she'd been exiled for befriending a member of the Winter Court. Then, she got to business. She described the "wild cats" they'd found.</p>

<p>Sertieren listened intently, then disappeared inside. He returned with a massive, dusty tome, which he slammed on the table, identifying the Thylacoleo. "You want me to buy them?" he chuckled. "This is a laboratory, young lady, not a bestiary."</p>

<p>"But they'll die!" [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] pleaded. "Isn't there a way to... store them? Like those magical balls you adventurers use?"</p>

<p>Sertieren’s eyes lit up. "Ah! Yes, containers. I can provide them." He offered her seven containment spheres for a single gold piece each, a 90% discount.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie], however, was broke, her money still cursed copper. "I don't have any money," she admitted. "But my friends do. Can I take them on credit?"</p>

<p>The wizard studied her. "I trust you," he said. "But... collateral." He placed a hand on her arm, and she felt a brief, magical sting. A glowing, arcane brand appeared on her wrist. "This will fade when the debt is paid. The spheres must be attuned to the creature with a name."</p>

<h3>A Profitable Debrief</h3>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] returned to the party. After a lively debate, they named their new companions: [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] claimed Tom and Garfield; [ENTITY:character:Soshi] took Milly and Yoli; and [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] adopted Avatar and Bella. They spoke the names and the command words, and the seven cubs vanished into their respective spheres.</p>

<p>The party marched back to Sertieren’s mansion. Two suits of animated armor barred the door, but they parted as the wizard emerged.</p>

<p>"Ah, my money," he smiled.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] paid the 7 gold. "We also have these," [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] said, presenting the Thylacoleo pelts. Sertieren offered 5 gold for each, but the party declined, deciding the hides would be better used to reinforce their own battered armor.</p>

<p>"What about this?" [ENTITY:character:Soshi] asked, presenting their half-kilo of Storm Dust.</p>

<p>Sertieren’s eyes widened. He took a tiny pinch and sniffed it, a look of ecstatic concentration on his face. "This is potent! I will buy it from you. 15 gold."</p>

<p>The deal was struck. "While you're here," [ENTITY:character:Soshi] said, "could you identify these?" She produced the vials they had recovered from the caves.</p>

<p>The wizard examined them closely. "This green one... this is demonic magic. It increases your vitality and mind, but leaves you vulnerable to... influence. This white one," he said, holding up the radiant vial, "is a simple, if potent, celerity potion. Thirty feet of extra movement for a minute." He then picked up the "Hops" potion. "This one grants immunity to poison for a day. The drawback, however... is severe, explosive dysentery. The creator noted it wasn't worth the cost to remove the side effect."</p>

<p>Finally, they showed him the preserved Artus Plura mushrooms and the stinking, acid-filled head of the cave worm. The wizard’s face lit up with academic glee. "Marvelous! The glands are intact!" He eagerly bought the worm head and the mushrooms for another 10 gold.</p>

<p>As they prepared to leave, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] asked one final question. "Sir... do you know of a mage named Kalistra?"</p>

<p>Sertieren’s smile faded. "I do," he said, his voice heavy. "A long time ago, before she foolishly joined your Brotherhood, we were in an adventuring party together. We called ourselves the 'Crazy Hogs.' But we... had a falling out. She was always pragmatic. She wanted to use an earthquake spell to clear a goblin cave, but it would have collapsed a nearby settlement. I... stole her spellbook to stop her."</p>

<p>He looked tired. "I'm leaving [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry] soon. The things you've seen—the hydras, these potions, the tribes uniting—they are all portents. A storm is coming, and I do not intend to be here when it breaks."</p>

<p>The party thanked the wizard and left his estate, their pockets significantly heavier and their minds buzzing with new information. They returned to the inn, weary but triumphant. Their plan was simple: barricade their doors, let the cubs out, and get some well-deserved rest.</p>
