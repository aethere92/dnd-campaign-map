<h3>II. Narrative Summary</h3>
<p><strong>The Leviathan&rsquo;s Hall</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>After escaping the collapsing caverns, the party (Bonnie, Kaedin, Soshi, Norr, and Olek) found themselves aboard a mysterious vessel pulled from the sea by grappling hooks.</li>
	<li>The ship, The Leviathan&rsquo;s Hall, was a massive black warship with green sails and a mixed pirate crew.</li>
	<li>Two commanding figures greeted them:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Commander Turiados &ndash; towering, tattooed warrior with Sahuagin ritual markings and the <em>Breaker of Hulls</em> cutlass (a Brotherhood relic).</li>
		<li>Commander Bianca Corina &ndash; fey-touched woman, Queen-in-exile of <em>Pelagos</em>, wielding <em>Winder</em>, a storm-forged glass blade (also stolen from the Brotherhood).</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Bianca and Turiados questioned the party about their arrival. Soshi explained their escape from the underground hydra lair and confirmed they were near the Sword Coast.</li>
	<li>Bianca and Turiados realized they were displaced from their homeland of <em>Lustria</em>, confused about their current location.</li>
	<li>They demanded a 20% &ldquo;rescue fee.&rdquo; Bonnie protested; tensions rose but no combat occurred.</li>
	<li>Bianca revealed her intent to reclaim her throne from <em>Sandro</em>, a necromancer who had murdered her father and usurped her kingdom.</li>
	<li>The crew&rsquo;s chant of loyalty revealed that the ship&rsquo;s company considered Bianca their rightful queen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exploring the Pirate Ship</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The deck was a chaotic mix of species: minotaurs, troglodytes, an Efreeti in the forge, and enslaved or augmented crewmates.</li>
	<li>Bonnie contacted Vandal telepathically; he warned her not to provoke the pirates and confirmed they had paid their &ldquo;rescue fee.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Bonnie befriended Marise Curs, a peg-legged pirate, and learned:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The crew once served a convict general named Lee, who freed them from a penal colony.</li>
		<li>Bianca took control of the ship after Lee's death.</li>
		<li>The crew are magically bound to Bianca&rsquo;s family by blood oath.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Kaedin met the dwarf smith Bardin Cratcho and an Efreeti forge master. Bardin offered to inscribe weapon runes for 50 gold, mocking Kaedin&rsquo;s inability to pay.</li>
	<li>Bonnie devised a plan to convince the pirates to &ldquo;raid&rdquo; the orc- and goblin-infested mountains near Drellin&rsquo;s Ferry, hoping to redirect them toward her personal objective: recovering magical boots from a necromancer&rsquo;s tower.</li>
	<li>She also met Glass, a massive Ice Elemental and Bianca&rsquo;s quartermaster. Glass confirmed Bianca had freed him from servitude, earning his eternal loyalty.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Negotiation and the Curse</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Soshi realized the ship was sailing <em>away</em> from Drellin&rsquo;s Ferry and convinced the group to negotiate.</li>
	<li>At the helm, Turiados&rsquo;s magical compass stopped spinning, pointing at Soshi&mdash;it revealed &ldquo;the direction of one&rsquo;s greatest desire.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Turiados offered to trade the compass if the party would bring him a <em>locket of hair</em> from the necromancer Sandro, giving them a carved whistle that would guide them to the target.</li>
	<li>Glass appeared to enforce the &ldquo;20% rescue fee,&rdquo; appraising their items.</li>
	<li>Bianca identified Soshi as a member of the Brotherhood, probing her motives; Soshi deflected.</li>
	<li>Bonnie mentioned having touched a cursed pirate coin. Glass confirmed the curse had spread to <em>all</em> their gold, turning their entire savings into unstable, near-worthless copper.</li>
	<li>Pirates confiscated 20% of their remaining valuables: Olek&rsquo;s javelins, Norr&rsquo;s climbing rope, and several pearls. Bianca tried to trade for Norr&rsquo;s Fey makeup kit but was denied.</li>
	<li>Bonnie attempted to drop a cursed coin as petty revenge; Bianca instantly reacted, blasting her with force magic.</li>
	<li>Turiados ordered, &ldquo;Row them to shore.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stranded on the Coast</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The party and the mercenaries Vandal and Scoundrel were cast adrift and left on a rocky beach.</li>
	<li>The mercenaries departed north on their reptilian mounts, warning of <em>undead pirates</em>.</li>
	<li>Soshi determined they were roughly six to seven hours from Drellin&rsquo;s Ferry. Traveling by night was too risky.</li>
	<li>She found a small cave for shelter. Bonnie set two concealed bear traps at the entrance.</li>
	<li>During the night watches:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Bonnie caught a giant seagull in her trap.</li>
		<li>Soshi witnessed crabs devouring the carcass.</li>
		<li>Kaedin&rsquo;s watch passed quietly.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ambush in the Oaks</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The next morning, Bonnie checked her cursed coins (still copper). Soshi and Norr&rsquo;s Eladrin forms shifted with the Summer Court.</li>
	<li>The party journeyed inland through dense oak forest. In a clearing, Bonnie spotted otters&mdash;then a Thylacoleo ambush.</li>
	<li>Combat ensued against three large marsupial predators.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Bonnie struck first with fey fire.</li>
		<li>Kaedin was mauled and grappled but escaped via Echo Knight abilities.</li>
		<li>Soshi was dragged into a tree but escaped using Misty Step and Mirror Image.</li>
		<li>Soshi Polymorphed Norr into a Giant Ape, turning the tide of battle.</li>
		<li>Bonnie finished the final beast with a precision strike.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>After the battle, the group skinned the creatures, salvaging three intact pelts and six fangs.</li>
	<li>They discovered seven Thylacoleo cubs in a tree hollow and decided to care for them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Return to Drellin&rsquo;s Ferry</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Avarthel&rsquo;s druid grove was empty&mdash;his snake guardian warned he was gone for months.</li>
	<li>Norr sought help from Brother Danny at the shrine, who was unhelpful.</li>
	<li>A goat-herd provided milk for the cubs in exchange for gold.</li>
	<li>Bonnie visited Sertieren the Wise, the town wizard, who offered containment spheres for the cubs&mdash;one gold each, requiring magical naming attunement.</li>
	<li>Lacking money, Bonnie agreed to &ldquo;collateral,&rdquo; earning a magical debt brand on her wrist.</li>
	<li>The cubs were named and stored:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Bonnie: <em>Tom</em> and <em>Garfield</em><em><br /></em></li>
		<li>Soshi: <em>Milly</em> and <em>Yoli</em><em><br /></em></li>
		<li>Kaedin: <em>Avatar</em> and <em>Bella</em><em><br /></em></li>
	</ul>
	<li>The group sold:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Storm Dust (15 gold)</li>
		<li>Cave worm head &amp; mushrooms (10 gold)</li>
	</ul>
	<li>They kept the Thylacoleo pelts for armor reinforcement.</li>
	<li>Sertieren identified their vials:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Green &ndash; <em>Demonic Vitality Serum</em> (buffs mind/body, risks corruption)</li>
		<li>White &ndash; <em>Potion of Celerity</em> (+30 ft speed for 1 min)</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Hops&rdquo; &ndash; <em>Poison Immunity + explosive side effect</em><em><br /></em></li>
	</ul>
	<li>Sertieren confirmed knowledge of Kalistra, Norr&rsquo;s old teacher, revealing she had been his former companion before joining the Brotherhood.</li>
	<li>He warned that recent events&mdash;hydras, alchemical traces, and tribal movements&mdash;were portents of a coming storm and intended to leave Drellin&rsquo;s Ferry soon.</li>
	<li>The party rested at the inn, financially recovered, with their new cub companions secured.</li>
</ul>
