<p>The party emerged from a subterranean ordeal only to be rescued by the colossal pirate warship, The Leviathan’s Hall. They were hauled aboard and brought before the ship's commanders, Turiados and Bianca.</p>

<p>Turiados, a towering man with Sahuagin shamanistic tattoos and a scent of brine and blood, wielded the Breaker of Hulls, a legendary cutlass [ENTITY:character:Soshi] recognized as stolen from her organization, the Brotherhood. Bianca, a Fey-touched woman with eyes that crackled with lightning, wore a velvet gown and possessed another stolen relic, the delicate, thunder-humming blade Winder. [ENTITY:character:Soshi] instantly recognized both weapons, confirming the commanders were highly dangerous and connected to a life she thought she’d left behind.</p>

<p>Bianca revealed herself as Commander Bianca, House Corina, the last true Queen of Pelagos (a continent called Lustria), vowing to reclaim her throne from the necromancer King Sandro. The pirates were hopelessly lost, having sailed far from their home across the Shining Sea, mistakenly ending up on the Sword Coast. They demanded a 20% rescue fee for their services.</p>

<p>While exploring the deck, the party gathered crucial intelligence. A drunken pirate, Marise Curs, boasted of their blood loyalty to Bianca's family and the commander's recent raids on [ENTITY:location:Brindol] trader vessels. He also revealed that the crew were former slaves from a penal colony, broken out by General Ilie, a man Bianca later betrayed to steal a ship. The party's two mercenary companions, [ENTITY:npc:Vandal] and Scoundrel, confirmed they intended to pay the fee and warned the party against any "stupid" actions.</p>

<p>During negotiations, the Ice Elemental Quartermaster, Glass, who spoke with agonizing slowness but was all business, assessed the party's assets. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], however, confessed that her gold was cursed copper—nearly worthless—due to a pirate coin she'd touched. The curse had spread to their entire savings. Glass declared the pirates wouldn't take the cursed money, but still demanded 20% of their non-monetary assets, taking [ENTITY:character:Olek]’s javelins, [ENTITY:character:Norr]’s climbing rope, and eight precious pearls.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Turiados, whose spinning compass pointed toward [ENTITY:character:Soshi]’s greatest desire (the portal home), offered to trade the compass for a locket of King Sandro’s hair, revealing a shared enemy with Bianca. When [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] attempted to slyly drop a cursed coin on the deck as a parting gift, Bianca reacted with lightning-fast aggression, blasting [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] with a powerful bolt of force and sending her sprawling. The party was then unceremoniously rowed to shore.</p>

<p>Dumped on a desolate beach near the forest, the party learned from the departing mercenaries, [ENTITY:npc:Vandal] and Scoundrel, that the region was also home to undead pirates. After a night of uneasy rest—marked by a giant seagull caught in [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]’s newly set bear trap and a swarm of crabs picking the carcass clean—the party set off toward [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry].</p>

<p>Six hours into their trek, the party was ambushed in an oak clearing by three Thylacoleos (massive, pouched predators). The beasts fought viciously, one grappling [ENTITY:character:Soshi] and another [ENTITY:character:Kaedin], dragging the Genasi up a tree. The battle saw [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] use a Misty Step teleport to strike from the branches, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] manifest his [ENTITY:subclass:Echo Knight] double to gain an advantage, and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] cast Polymorph to turn [ENTITY:character:Norr] into a powerful Giant Ape. The party managed to defeat the beasts, but the Giant Ape form took significant damage.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] salvaged three pelts and some fangs from the creatures. They also discovered the reason for the attack: seven impossibly cute Thylacoleo cubs hidden in a hollow tree, prompting the party to take them in rather than leave them to die.</p>

<p>In [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry], the local druid, [ENTITY:npc:Avarthel], had left. Desperate, the party fed the cubs with a local goat-herd’s milk and then approached the wizard Sertieren. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] successfully convinced the old mage to sell her seven containment spheres—a form of magical storage—on credit to save the creatures. As collateral, Sertieren placed a magical, glowing brand on [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]’s wrist, to fade once the debt of 7 gold was paid.</p>

<p>At the wizard’s mansion, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] paid the debt. The party then sold Sertieren their half-kilo of Storm Dust for 15 gold and the preserved head of a cave worm and Artus Plura mushrooms for 10 gold, significantly replenishing their funds. Sertieren also identified the vials they'd recovered from the caves, including a celerity potion and a potent anti-poison potion with the side effect of "severe, explosive dysentery."</p>

<p>Finally, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] asked about the mage Kalistra (a former Brotherhood member). Sertieren revealed they were once in an adventuring party called the "Crazy Hogs" but had a falling out after he stole her spellbook to prevent her from casting an earthquake spell that would have destroyed a nearby settlement. The wizard warned the party that a storm is coming, referencing the hydras, potions, and tribal unity they’d witnessed, and that he intends to leave town soon. The party left the wizard’s estate, wealthier and armed with new knowledge, and headed to the inn for a much-needed rest.</p>
