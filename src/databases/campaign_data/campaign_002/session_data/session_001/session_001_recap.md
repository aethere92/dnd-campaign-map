<p>Five strangers walk a path less traveled—through tangled weeds and whispering trees—toward the town of [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry]. Though their footsteps fall in unison now, each of them carries a life shaped by fate, tragedy, and a desire for something more. They are unlikely allies, bound together by choice or chance, but united in purpose... for now.</p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek], a [ENTITY:class:Paladin] of Helm, walks with the calm strength of one touched by the divine. Raised by wolves, orphaned by war, and uplifted by a celestial being, his journey is one of service and steadfast honor. With a heart full of duty and a past veiled in fire, he brings light to the dark places they travel.</p>

<p>Beside him walks [ENTITY:character:Norr], a [ENTITY:class:Sorcerer] touched by dragon's blood and haunted by a stolen map. Fleeing the shadows of the [ENTITY:guild:Arcane Brotherhood] with her closest companion, she guards her secrets with sharp wit and quiet strength. Her friend, [ENTITY:character:Soshi]—a Feyborn wizard who traded whimsy for power—shares in that escape, both burdened by the Brotherhood's darkness and driven by dreams of belonging.</p>

<p>Then there's [ENTITY:character:Kaedin], the [ENTITY:subclass:Echo Knight] genasi who seeks a friend lost to a trap and a mystery buried in time. Haunted by visions of other lives and trained to wield them as weapons, he wears tradition on his sleeve and carries the past on his back, each step a search for answers that lie beyond the veil of fate.</p>

<p>And finally, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]—a [ENTITY:class:rogue] pixie exiled from the [ENTITY:location:Feywilds] for loving too deeply and breaking too many rules. With [ENTITY:npc:Jacques] the rat at her side and chaos in her wake, she hides a loyal heart beneath layers of mischief. Together, these five travel toward [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry], carrying hope, grief, ambition, and mischief in equal measure. What awaits them on the road is still unwritten.</p>
