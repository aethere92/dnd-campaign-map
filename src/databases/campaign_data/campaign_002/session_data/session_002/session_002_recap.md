<p>Our weary heroes journey toward [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry] on their fourth day of travel through the monotonous lands of Elsir Vale. As they crest a low rise, they discover an abandoned farmhouse in a dusty grove—the perfect setting for an ambush, as [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] shrewdly notes. Her instincts prove correct when hobgoblins attack from the brush.</p>
<p>The ensuing battle is fierce, but our heroes display remarkable teamwork: [ENTITY:character:Norr]'s lightning combining with [ENTITY:character:Soshi]'s flames, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]'s echo striking in tandem with [ENTITY:character:Olek]'s glowing club, and [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] delivering the final blow with precise dagger work. When the dust settles, they capture one hobgoblin alive for questioning.</p>
<p>Inside the farmhouse, they discover three murdered travelers. Despite [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]'s interrogation skills and [ENTITY:character:Olek]'s [ENTITY:spell:Zone of Truth], the creature remains silent until he finally bargains: answers in exchange for a swift death from the paladin. He reveals his leader is [ENTITY:npc:Wyrmlord Koth], a sorcerer gathering tribes for "the Day of Ruin," but refuses to disclose their location. After fulfilling his promise to the hobgoblin, [ENTITY:character:Olek] and the party burn the dead to prevent necromantic misuse.</p>
<p>As they travel stealthily toward town, [ENTITY:character:Olek] spots a farmer and his sons heading toward danger. In his well-meaning attempt to warn them, the glowing aasimar terrifies the family, who flee screaming—a situation [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] worsens by whispering "Boo" telepathically into the farmer's mind. [ENTITY:character:Olek], distressed by their reaction, insists on returning their abandoned supplies—though mysteriously, the cart's wine vanishes before it's restored.</p>
<p>Finally reaching [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry], our heroes are greeted by town guards who inform them of increased raids in the area. The party splits to pursue individual goals: [ENTITY:character:Olek] and [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] heading to the tollhouse, [ENTITY:character:Norr] and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] to the Shrine of Pelor, and [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] to find the wizard's mansion.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek] and [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]'s journey takes an unexpected turn when children approach them seeking the tooth-fairy. Amidst the magical entertainment they provide, a small boy asks for help with his abusive father. They visit his home where [ENTITY:character:Olek] heals the mother's visible injuries, though she denies any abuse. Outside, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] attempts to slip the boy a dagger before [ENTITY:character:Olek] intervenes, and they promise to return the next day.</p>
<p>At the tollhouse, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] meets [ENTITY:npc:Sorana] to deliver a package containing magical artifacts, learning that the "Dead Man's Boots" were last possessed by a necromancer who disappeared in the Witchwood. Meanwhile, town leader Norro explains their troubles with raiders and offers rewards for stopping them.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, [ENTITY:character:Norr] and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] purchase offerings at the market before visiting the Shrine of Pelor. There, Brother Denny awkwardly attempts to hear their confessions, while the druid Avartel shares information about a cursed fortress called Wrath Keep near a lake in the Witchwood, guarded by skeletons.</p>
<p>Finally, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] visits Sertieren's manor, where he's greeted by a talking fountain and the eccentric wizard himself. Over questionable rum, Sertieren rambles about odd vanishings, the Chronomancers of [ENTITY:guild:Krynn], and a magical nexus somewhere in the Witchwood. Though mostly offering rumors rather than concrete information about [ENTITY:npc:Thalos]'s disappearance, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] departs with new leads to pursue.</p>
<p>As dusk falls over [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry], our separated heroes make their way to reunite, each carrying pieces of a mystery that seems to center on the ominous Witchwood and the threats gathering within it.</p>
