<p>We begin on the fourth day of travel. Afternoon has settled in, the sun still burning, the air hot and still. The lands of Elsir Vale have blurred by now - every town looks the same, and our heroes can no longer tell one from the next.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry] lies just a few miles ahead - both their destination and their long-awaited respite from the arduous road. Conversation has grown scarce. After four days on the road, there's little left to say, and even less to want beyond a soft bed and a hot meal. A small question here and there - "<span class="dialogue">So you really don't know where a fey portal is?</span>" - and the occasional mage hand prank: a flick of the forehead, a stone in a boot. And so, our weary party presses on.</p>
<p>The road crests a low rise and dips into a dusty grove nestled in a shallow dell. An abandoned farmhouse, half-hidden behind trees, leans tiredly by the roadside. They've passed places like this before - but something about this one feels wrong.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] tilts her head and hums, voice light but sharp. "<span class="dialogue">If I were a thief - and I'm not saying I am - this would be the perfect place for an ambush.</span>" The others glance around, unsure if she's being paranoid or perceptive.</p>
<h3>The fight</h3>
<p>Then they see it - the glint of mail behind the brush. Tall, fierce warriors. Hairy, with wide mouths and flat faces. Waiting patiently for unsuspecting prey.</p>
<p>The fight is long. Dangerous. The enemies are many, and the road has drained our heroes. The terrain does them no favors - tall grass and wreckage obscure their view, and the foes come from all sides. But even in the chaos, they begin to move as one. Combos fly. Tactics form. Help is given before it's asked for.</p>
<p>A true display of teamwork comes when they face the enemy captain. From afar, lightning sparks from [ENTITY:character:Norr]'s fingers, a bolt cutting through the air. Mirroring her motion, like twin sisters in perfect harmony, flames burst from [ENTITY:character:Soshi]'s hands, wrapping the lightning in fire. The bolt finds its mark just as [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]'s echo flickers into place beside the captain - his blade striking in tandem with [ENTITY:character:Olek]'s glowing club, one from the front, one from behind. And then [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], ever the performer, sheds crocodile tears as her dagger sinks deep in his heart, in a flash of glinting mischief and precision. There is nothing left of him. In the wake of such relentless force, a voice cries out from the shadows. A signal. A retreat.</p>
<p>When the dust settles, only one enemy remains. They keep him alive - not out of mercy, but purpose. There are questions to be asked, and answers to be found. Something is stirring in these lands.</p>
<p>Even though the fight was over, it was not a time to relax. They searched for clues and information - and maybe for small treasures - as they dragged their captive toward the nearly ruined house. Inside, they found three dead travelers, clearly different from the creatures that had attacked them. Struck down, it seemed, as they passed through on their own path.</p>
<h3>Interrogation</h3>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] offered to handle the interrogation. She was the only one who spoke the creature's language, and she seemed certain she could extract the answers they needed.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek], in his ever-merciful manner, decided to make things fair and called upon his patron to cast a [ENTITY:spell:Zone of Truth]. No lies could be spoken within its bounds. And yet, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]'s efforts hit a wall - no amount of pain or threats, calm or enraged, made the creature utter a single word. What perhaps should have been noticed was this: [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] did not lie once, could not actually. Every horror she described, she meant.</p>
<p>As the group debated their next step, something shifted. A glint of understanding appeared in the creature's eyes. He could understand them - and more than that, he finally spoke: <span class="dialogue">"I will answer only if the paladin promises to deliver me a swift death."</span></p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek] agreed. In exchange for three answers to three questions, he gave his word - and his word is not one given lightly.</p>
<p>The questions were straightforward:
<ul><li>Who is your Warlord?</li>
<li>What are you planning here?</li>
<li>Where are you located?</li></ul>
<p>The answers, unfortunately, were not.</p>
<p>The hobgoblin didn't seem to know much- and what he did know only brought more confusion than clarity. A name and a purpose were given: [ENTITY:npc:Wyrmlord Koth], a mighty sorcerer, gathering the tribes for "the Day of Ruin." A place, however, was denied. Either the creature refused to explain, or he truly didn't know how to lead them there.</p>
<p>In the absence of a clear third answer, the group asked something else. Among the belongings of the dead, they had found a strange symbol - a sun, with a red hand painted in its center. The hobgoblin seemed to recognize it. His reaction was clear. But still, he gave them nothing more.</p>
<p>With nothing else to say and no answers left to give, [ENTITY:character:Olek] stepped forward to fulfill his promise. But just before he struck, an idea was voiced- What if we take him to town? Maybe someone there can read his thoughts?</p>
<p>For a heartbeat, [ENTITY:character:Olek] hesitated. A promise to his friends... a hope for more knowledge. But then he remembered the first promise - the one made in the circle of truth, under the gaze of his god.</p>
<p>He did not break his word.</p>
<p>Not to the hobgoblin.</p>
<p>Not to Helm.</p>
<p>Before continuing their way toward [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry], [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] made a request: to burn the dead, to ensure they couldn't be used in any... unsavory ways. And after the flames had done their work, to extinguish the fire completely - to protect the forest and its living creatures from further harm.</p>
<p>Starting a fire is easy. Putting one out, not so much. It took them nearly an hour, working together, dousing embers and stamping out flame. They were losing the light of day, and with it, some measure of safety in that secluded place.</p>
<p>Once the task was done, they agreed to conceal their presence and travel quietly, slipping through trees and underbrush with as little noise as possible.</p>
<h3>Towards Drellin's Ferry</h3>
<p>Now, what I'm about to tell you is a brief break from the seriousness and urgency - a little moment of levity in the midst of tension. A bit of comedic relief, if you will.</p>
<p>As they made their way through the forest, slow and steady, trying to reach the city unnoticed, [ENTITY:character:Olek] spotted something up ahead - a farmer and his two sons, walking down the road straight toward the ruined farmhouse. Toward the danger that had, just minutes ago, threatened their lives.</p>
<p>Now, you may recall, [ENTITY:character:Olek] is not exactly inconspicuous. He's an aasimar - angelic wings, radiant features, glowing with divine presence. He doesn't quite realize how unusual he looks. So, in all sincerity, he said, "<span class="dialogue">I need to go out and warn them. The place isn't safe.</span>"</p>
<p>For three regular folks, minding their own business in the middle of nowhere, having a giant shining celestial being suddenly emerge from the underbrush is… not exactly a routine occurrence.</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">Halt,</span>" [ENTITY:character:Olek] said. "<span class="dialogue">The way you're going is not safe - </span>"</p>
<p>He didn't even get to finish.</p>
<p>The farmer and his sons immediately began screaming bloody murder, terrified out of their wits by the glowing figure before them. [ENTITY:character:Olek], determined to help, stepped forward, trying to calm them down.</p>
<p>The screaming only got louder.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek] tried again.</p>
<p>Still louder.</p>
<p>And then - [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], watching this entire scene unfold with glee, decided she couldn't let the opportunity go to waste. She reached out with her magic, and whispered telepathically into the farmer's mind a single word:</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">Boo.</span>"</p>
<p>That was it. That did it.</p>
<p>The poor family dropped everything - abandoned their cart, left their goods behind - and sprinted down the road like the Nine Hells themselves were on their heels. Caution be damned.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek] returned looking downcast. He was upset that he couldn't help the family, but even more so by the reaction he had gotten. He had only wanted to keep them safe- how could it have gone so wrong?</p>
<p>What none of them noticed in the chaos was [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], who had already slipped away to the abandoned cart. Quick as ever, she grabbed the wine and stashed it safely, then returned with some food and other supplies. "<span class="dialogue">No sense letting it all go to waste,</span>" she reasoned. They did need to eat, after all. She even left behind some green vegetables, claiming it was out of kindness for the family in case they returned - though truthfully, she just didn't like those kinds.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek], already burdened by guilt over what had happened, refused to keep the supplies. He gathered them back into the cart, hoping the family might return for what was theirs.</p>
<p>Everything was put back where it belonged - everything except the poorly made wine. Because as far as anyone else knew, that wine never existed in the first place.</p>
<p>After four long and eventful days, our heroes finally reached [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry].</p>
<h3>Reaching Drellin's Ferry</h3>
[IMAGE:images/assets/campaign_002/locations/drellin_ferry_map.png::400px::true]
<p>The town lay mostly along the banks of a broad, sluggish river. Six old stone piers jutted from the water, marking the place where a bridge once stood - but the span itself had long since disappeared. In its place, thick ropes stretched across the river, anchored to a pair of flat-bottomed ferryboats. Brown fields and green orchards surrounded the town, and five newly built watchtowers stood tall - a curious sight for a place like this.</p>
<p>As they moved forward, they were met by a group of armed townsfolk - three clad in leather, one in mail. </p><p>"<span class="dialogue">Halt and state your business, strangers,</span>" one of the guards called out, clearly wary of unfamiliar faces.</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">We mean you no harm,</span>" [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] said, her voice light and sweet. "<span class="dialogue">We're travelers from [ENTITY:location:Brindol], here on business in town. You should know - we ran into trouble on the road. Might want to send someone to check on a farmer and his sons heading that way.</span>"</p>
<p>She went on to describe the hobgoblin ambush and the gruesome scene they'd left behind, mentioning the poor family that had headed straight into danger.</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">Ah… I'm sure they'll be fine,</span>" the guard replied - Sergeant Hersk, as he introduced himself. He told them about other recent attacks - goblins, orcs, and worse - and spoke grimly of the Witchwood, the cursed forest nearby, said to be full of unnatural things. Undead. Lost travelers. Whispers and rumors, some plausible, others wildly exaggerated.</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">We understand,</span>" said one of the group. "<span class="dialogue">Now, could you point us in a few directions?</span>"</p>
<p>They asked where they could find a place to sleep, where to locate someone named Sorana, and what other important landmarks might be worth noting.</p>
<p>Sergeant Hersk obliged. Most activity, he said, now centered around the tollhouse. A shrine could be found in town, and a powerful wizard made his home here as well.</p>
<p>They thanked him, and - though it's rarely a wise move - they split the party.</p>
<p>Since everyone had business - whether out in the open or shrouded in secrets - they agreed to split up, each pursuing their own path while still united in purpose. [ENTITY:character:Olek] and [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] made their way to the tollhouse, [ENTITY:character:Norr] and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] headed for the Shrine of Pellor, and [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] set out to find the mansion of the old wizard.</p>
<h3>Olek and Bonnie</h3>
<p>We begin with our most unlikely pair - [ENTITY:character:Olek] and [ENTITY:character:Bonnie].</p>
<p>They walked through the town at a steady pace, not rushed but purposeful, taking in the sights and sounds of [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry]. As they moved, two small children approached them, eyes wide and hopeful, holding a tiny pouch filled with what could only be baby teeth.</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">Sir, sir!</span>" one of them cried. "<span class="dialogue">We heard the tooth-fairy is in town! Do you know where to find her?</span>"</p>
<p>Before [ENTITY:character:Olek] could answer, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] leaned down with a warm smile. <span class="dialogue">"I'm not sure about the tooth-fairy,</span>" she said, "<span class="dialogue">but a fairy is in town.</span>" With that, she fluttered her wings and conjured a swirl of tiny, dancing illusions - glimmering fairies that sparkled in the air around them.</p>
<p>The children squealed with delight.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek], not one to be outshone in kindness, summoned his floating disk and gently lifted the kids onto it, much to their giggling joy. Within moments, they were swarmed by a crowd of laughing, excited children, enchanted by the display of magic and warmth.</p>
<p>But then, slowly pushing through the crowd, came a smaller child. His expression carried a sadness far too heavy for someone his age. He tugged gently at [ENTITY:character:Olek]'s armor.</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">Sir… could you please help my mom?</span>" he asked quietly. "<span class="dialogue">My father hurts her. She's always sad, and always in pain.</span>"</p>
<p>The weight of those words struck both [ENTITY:character:Olek] and [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] like a hammer. The laughter around them faded into the background as their focus shifted entirely.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek] knelt to the boy's level. "<span class="dialogue">Will you show me where you live?</span>" he asked gently.</p>
<p>The boy nodded, and the trio set off. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], surrounded by her squealing, sparkling parade, followed [ENTITY:character:Olek] and the child carefully - her face still light, but her mind already sharpened for what lay ahead.</p>
<p>They arrived at a normal house, the door slightly ajar. [ENTITY:character:Olek] knocked once and gently pushed it open, while [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] waited outside with the boy and their merry group of squealing children.</p>
<p>Inside, the boy's mother looked up, startled by the stranger stepping into her home. She appeared frail and gentle, a dark bruise already forming on her cheek.</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">Who are you?</span>" she asked, concerned.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek] introduced himself, explaining that her child had helped him find his way here. He asked, voice full of concern, "<span class="dialogue">What happened to your face?</span>" reaching out carefully, just his fingertips brushing near the wound.</p>
<p>The mother hesitated, her body language giving away more than she probably intended. She lied, saying she had fallen and hurt herself.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek] let the lie pass. Without a word, he laid his hand upon her cheek and healed her injuries - if not the ones beneath the skin, at least the ones he could reach.</p>
<p>The woman's eyes widened in shock before softening into gratitude. She thanked him, voice trembling slightly.</p>
<p>He tried to coax her into speaking, asking about her family, her husband, but she said little. Nothing useful. Only that her husband would return the next day.</p>
<p>Outside, while still entertaining the other children, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] kept a sharp ear on the conversation. Unsatisfied with how things were going, frustrated at the lack of truth, she whispered to the boy, teaching him quietly how to protect himself and his mother. Unlucky for her, just as she was about to slip him a small dagger, [ENTITY:character:Olek] emerged from the house - more perceptive than usual - and caught the whole scene before it could unfold.</p>
<p>They said their goodbyes to the boy, promising him they would return the next day to have a word with the father.</p>
