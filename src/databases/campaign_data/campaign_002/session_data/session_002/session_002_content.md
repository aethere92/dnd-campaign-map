<p>We begin on the fourth day of travel. Afternoon has settled in, the sun still burning, the air hot and still. The lands of Elsir Vale have blurred by now - every town looks the same, and our heroes can no longer tell one from the next.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry] lies just a few miles ahead - both their destination and their long-awaited respite from the arduous road. Conversation has grown scarce. After four days on the road, there's little left to say, and even less to want beyond a soft bed and a hot meal. A small question here and there - "<span class="dialogue">So you really don't know where a fey portal is?</span>" - and the occasional mage hand prank: a flick of the forehead, a stone in a boot. And so, our weary party presses on.</p>
<p>The road crests a low rise and dips into a dusty grove nestled in a shallow dell. An abandoned farmhouse, half-hidden behind trees, leans tiredly by the roadside. They've passed places like this before - but something about this one feels wrong.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] tilts her head and hums, voice light but sharp. "<span class="dialogue">If I were a thief - and I'm not saying I am - this would be the perfect place for an ambush.</span>" The others glance around, unsure if she's being paranoid or perceptive.</p>

<h3>The fight</h3>

<p>Then they see it - the glint of mail behind the brush. Tall, fierce warriors. Hairy, with wide mouths and flat faces. Waiting patiently for unsuspecting prey.</p>
<p>The fight is long. Dangerous. The enemies are many, and the road has drained our heroes. The terrain does them no favors - tall grass and wreckage obscure their view, and the foes come from all sides. But even in the chaos, they begin to move as one. Combos fly. Tactics form. Help is given before it's asked for.</p>
<p>A true display of teamwork comes when they face the enemy captain. From afar, lightning sparks from [ENTITY:character:Norr]'s fingers, a bolt cutting through the air. Mirroring her motion, like twin sisters in perfect harmony, flames burst from [ENTITY:character:Soshi]'s hands, wrapping the lightning in fire. The bolt finds its mark just as [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]'s echo flickers into place beside the captain - his blade striking in tandem with [ENTITY:character:Olek]'s glowing club, one from the front, one from behind. And then [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], ever the performer, sheds crocodile tears as her dagger sinks deep in his heart, in a flash of glinting mischief and precision. There is nothing left of him. In the wake of such relentless force, a voice cries out from the shadows. A signal. A retreat.</p>
<p>When the dust settles, only one enemy remains. They keep him alive - not out of mercy, but purpose. There are questions to be asked, and answers to be found. Something is stirring in these lands.</p>
<p>Even though the fight was over, it was not a time to relax. They searched for clues and information - and maybe for small treasures - as they dragged their captive toward the nearly ruined house. Inside, they found three dead travelers, clearly different from the creatures that had attacked them. Struck down, it seemed, as they passed through on their own path.</p>

<h3>Interrogation</h3>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] offered to handle the interrogation. She was the only one who spoke the creature's language, and she seemed certain she could extract the answers they needed.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek], in his ever-merciful manner, decided to make things fair and called upon his patron to cast a [ENTITY:spell:Zone of Truth]. No lies could be spoken within its bounds. And yet, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie]'s efforts hit a wall - no amount of pain or threats, calm or enraged, made the creature utter a single word. What perhaps should have been noticed was this: [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] did not lie once, could not actually. Every horror she described, she meant.</p>
<p>As the group debated their next step, something shifted. A glint of understanding appeared in the creature's eyes. He could understand them - and more than that, he finally spoke: <span class="dialogue">"I will answer only if the paladin promises to deliver me a swift death."</span></p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek] agreed. In exchange for three answers to three questions, he gave his word - and his word is not one given lightly.</p>
<p>The questions were straightforward:
<ul>
    <li>Who is your Warlord?</li>
    <li>What are you planning here?</li>
    <li>Where are you located?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers, unfortunately, were not.</p>
<p>The hobgoblin didn't seem to know much- and what he did know only brought more confusion than clarity. A name and a purpose were given: [ENTITY:npc:Wyrmlord Koth], a mighty sorcerer, gathering the tribes for "the Day of Ruin." A place, however, was denied. Either the creature refused to explain, or he truly didn't know how to lead them there.</p>
<p>In the absence of a clear third answer, the group asked something else. Among the belongings of the dead, they had found a strange symbol - a sun, with a red hand painted in its center. The hobgoblin seemed to recognize it. His reaction was clear. But still, he gave them nothing more.</p>
<p>With nothing else to say and no answers left to give, [ENTITY:character:Olek] stepped forward to fulfill his promise. But just before he struck, an idea was voiced- What if we take him to town? Maybe someone there can read his thoughts?</p>
<p>For a heartbeat, [ENTITY:character:Olek] hesitated. A promise to his friends... a hope for more knowledge. But then he remembered the first promise - the one made in the circle of truth, under the gaze of his god.</p>
<p>He did not break his word.</p>
<p>Not to the hobgoblin.</p>
<p>Not to Helm.</p>
<p>Before continuing their way toward [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry], [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] made a request: to burn the dead, to ensure they couldn't be used in any... unsavory ways. And after the flames had done their work, to extinguish the fire completely - to protect the forest and its living creatures from further harm.</p>
<p>Starting a fire is easy. Putting one out, not so much. It took them nearly an hour, working together, dousing embers and stamping out flame. They were losing the light of day, and with it, some measure of safety in that secluded place.</p>
<p>Once the task was done, they agreed to conceal their presence and travel quietly, slipping through trees and underbrush with as little noise as possible.</p>
<h3>Towards Drellin's Ferry</h3>
<p>Now, what I'm about to tell you is a brief break from the seriousness and urgency - a little moment of levity in the midst of tension. A bit of comedic relief, if you will.</p>
<p>As they made their way through the forest, slow and steady, trying to reach the city unnoticed, [ENTITY:character:Olek] spotted something up ahead - a farmer and his two sons, walking down the road straight toward the ruined farmhouse. Toward the danger that had, just minutes ago, threatened their lives.</p>
<p>Now, you may recall, [ENTITY:character:Olek] is not exactly inconspicuous. He's an aasimar - angelic wings, radiant features, glowing with divine presence. He doesn't quite realize how unusual he looks. So, in all sincerity, he said, "<span class="dialogue">I need to go out and warn them. The place isn't safe.</span>"</p>
<p>For three regular folks, minding their own business in the middle of nowhere, having a giant shining celestial being suddenly emerge from the underbrush isâ€¦ not exactly a routine occurrence.</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">Halt,</span>" [ENTITY:character:Olek] said. "<span class="dialogue">The way you're going is not safe - </span>"</p>
<p>He didn't even get to finish.</p>
<p>The farmer and his sons immediately began screaming bloody murder, terrified out of their wits by the glowing figure before them. [ENTITY:character:Olek], determined to help, stepped forward, trying to calm them down.</p>
<p>The screaming only got louder.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek] tried again.</p>
<p>Still louder.</p>
<p>And then - [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], watching this entire scene unfold with glee, decided she couldn't let the opportunity go to waste. She reached out with her magic, and whispered telepathically into the farmer's mind a single word:</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">Boo.</span>"</p>
<p>That was it. That did it.</p>
<p>The poor family dropped everything - abandoned their cart, left their goods behind - and sprinted down the road like the Nine Hells themselves were on their heels. Caution be damned.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek] returned looking downcast. He was upset that he couldn't help the family, but even more so by the reaction he had gotten. He had only wanted to keep them safe- how could it have gone so wrong?</p>
<p>What none of them noticed in the chaos was [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], who had already slipped away to the abandoned cart. Quick as ever, she grabbed the wine and stashed it safely, then returned with some food and other supplies. "<span class="dialogue">No sense letting it all go to waste,</span>" she reasoned. They did need to eat, after all. She even left behind some green vegetables, claiming it was out of kindness for the family in case they returned - though truthfully, she just didn't like those kinds.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek], already burdened by guilt over what had happened, refused to keep the supplies. He gathered them back into the cart, hoping the family might return for what was theirs.</p>
<p>Everything was put back where it belonged - everything except the poorly made wine. Because as far as anyone else knew, that wine never existed in the first place.</p>
<p>After four long and eventful days, our heroes finally reached [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry].</p>

<h3>Reaching Drellin's Ferry</h3>

[IMAGE:images/assets/campaign_002/locations/drellin_ferry_map.png::300px::true]

<p>The town lay mostly along the banks of a broad, sluggish river. Six old stone piers jutted from the water, marking the place where a bridge once stood - but the span itself had long since disappeared. In its place, thick ropes stretched across the river, anchored to a pair of flat-bottomed ferryboats. Brown fields and green orchards surrounded the town, and five newly built watchtowers stood tall - a curious sight for a place like this.</p>
<p>As they moved forward, they were met by a group of armed townsfolk - three clad in leather, one in mail. </p><p>"<span class="dialogue">Halt and state your business, strangers,</span>" one of the guards called out, clearly wary of unfamiliar faces.</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">We mean you no harm,</span>" [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] said, her voice light and sweet. "<span class="dialogue">We're travelers from [ENTITY:location:Brindol], here on business in town. You should know - we ran into trouble on the road. Might want to send someone to check on a farmer and his sons heading that way.</span>"</p>
<p>She went on to describe the hobgoblin ambush and the gruesome scene they'd left behind, mentioning the poor family that had headed straight into danger.</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">Ahâ€¦ I'm sure they'll be fine,</span>" the guard replied - Sergeant Hersk, as he introduced himself. He told them about other recent attacks - goblins, orcs, and worse - and spoke grimly of the Witchwood, the cursed forest nearby, said to be full of unnatural things. Undead. Lost travelers. Whispers and rumors, some plausible, others wildly exaggerated.</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">We understand,</span>" said one of the group. "<span class="dialogue">Now, could you point us in a few directions?</span>"</p>
<p>They asked where they could find a place to sleep, where to locate someone named [ENTITY:npc:Soranna], and what other important landmarks might be worth noting.</p>
<p>Sergeant Hersk obliged. Most activity, he said, now centered around the tollhouse. A shrine could be found in town, and a powerful wizard made his home here as well.</p>
<p>They thanked him, and - though it's rarely a wise move - they split the party.</p>
<p>Since everyone had business - whether out in the open or shrouded in secrets - they agreed to split up, each pursuing their own path while still united in purpose. [ENTITY:character:Olek] and [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] made their way to the tollhouse, [ENTITY:character:Norr] and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] headed for the Shrine of Pellor, and [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] set out to find the mansion of the old wizard.</p>

<h3>Olek and Bonnie</h3>

<p>We begin with our most unlikely pair - [ENTITY:character:Olek] and [ENTITY:character:Bonnie].</p>
<p>They walked through the town at a steady pace, not rushed but purposeful, taking in the sights and sounds of [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry]. As they moved, two small children approached them, eyes wide and hopeful, holding a tiny pouch filled with what could only be baby teeth.</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">Sir, sir!</span>" one of them cried. "<span class="dialogue">We heard the tooth-fairy is in town! Do you know where to find her?</span>"</p>
<p>Before [ENTITY:character:Olek] could answer, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] leaned down with a warm smile. <span class="dialogue">"I'm not sure about the tooth-fairy,</span>" she said, "<span class="dialogue">but a fairy is in town.</span>" With that, she fluttered her wings and conjured a swirl of tiny, dancing illusions - glimmering fairies that sparkled in the air around them.</p>
<p>The children squealed with delight.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek], not one to be outshone in kindness, summoned his floating disk and gently lifted the kids onto it, much to their giggling joy. Within moments, they were swarmed by a crowd of laughing, excited children, enchanted by the display of magic and warmth.</p>
<p>But then, slowly pushing through the crowd, came a smaller child. His expression carried a sadness far too heavy for someone his age. He tugged gently at [ENTITY:character:Olek]'s armor.</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">Sirâ€¦ could you please help my mom?</span>" he asked quietly. "<span class="dialogue">My father hurts her. She's always sad, and always in pain.</span>"</p>
<p>The weight of those words struck both [ENTITY:character:Olek] and [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] like a hammer. The laughter around them faded into the background as their focus shifted entirely.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek] knelt to the boy's level. "<span class="dialogue">Will you show me where you live?</span>" he asked gently.</p>
<p>The boy nodded, and the trio set off. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], surrounded by her squealing, sparkling parade, followed [ENTITY:character:Olek] and the child carefully - her face still light, but her mind already sharpened for what lay ahead.</p>
<p>They arrived at a normal house, the door slightly ajar. [ENTITY:character:Olek] knocked once and gently pushed it open, while [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] waited outside with the boy and their merry group of squealing children.</p>
<p>Inside, the boy's mother looked up, startled by the stranger stepping into her home. She appeared frail and gentle, a dark bruise already forming on her cheek.</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">Who are you?</span>" she asked, concerned.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek] introduced himself, explaining that her child had helped him find his way here. He asked, voice full of concern, "<span class="dialogue">What happened to your face?</span>" reaching out carefully, just his fingertips brushing near the wound.</p>
<p>The mother hesitated, her body language giving away more than she probably intended. She lied, saying she had fallen and hurt herself.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek] let the lie pass. Without a word, he laid his hand upon her cheek and healed her injuries - if not the ones beneath the skin, at least the ones he could reach.</p>
<p>The woman's eyes widened in shock before softening into gratitude. She thanked him, voice trembling slightly.</p>
<p>He tried to coax her into speaking, asking about her family, her husband, but she said little. Nothing useful. Only that her husband would return the next day.</p>
<p>Outside, while still entertaining the other children, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] kept a sharp ear on the conversation. Unsatisfied with how things were going, frustrated at the lack of truth, she whispered to the boy, teaching him quietly how to protect himself and his mother. Unlucky for her, just as she was about to slip him a small dagger, [ENTITY:character:Olek] emerged from the house - more perceptive than usual - and caught the whole scene before it could unfold.</p>
<p>They said their goodbyes to the boy, promising him they would return the next day to have a word with the father.</p>
<p>With heavier hearts than before, [ENTITY:character:Olek] and [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] made their way back into the town's bustling streets. There was still much to be done, and the day was far from over.</p>
<p>After their brief encounter with the child and his mother, they kept the road straight to the tollhouse - no more cheery or excited with the new city.</p>
<p>As they reached the tollhouse and stepped inside, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], ever on the lookout, quickly noticed the state of things: about twenty guards were present, most seeming more like farmers than soldiers, with only a handful appearing slightly more experienced. This sight did not please her; it meant the city's defenses were even worse than she first feared. The room split into several corridors, each leading to different locations, and she noticed the captain's office and knocked.</p>
<p>A tall, young woman with a stony face was deep in conversation with an older man in rich garb, a bald head, and a bushy beard.</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">Hello, I am looking for [ENTITY:npc:Soranna]</span>", said [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] as she opened the door, [ENTITY:character:Olek] right next to her.</p>
<p>The young woman looked toward them and answered that she was [ENTITY:npc:Soranna], asking what she could do for them.</p>
<p>Now, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] hadn't shared everything with the group - for discretion, but also out of lack of trust - and so, as she presented herself and [ENTITY:character:Olek] to the two people, she spoke to [ENTITY:npc:Soranna] mind-to-mind: <span class="dialogue"><i>I have a package for you. I was sent by Rilon Paln.</i></span></p>
<p>[ENTITY:npc:Soranna] responded in turn, asking to see the package.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] handed over the envelope, inside it the leather-wrapped and strange artifact. [ENTITY:npc:Soranna] muttered in a dreadful, evil-sounding language, and the artifact opened, revealing four items to be found - though she spoke only of the first one to [ENTITY:character:Bonnie].</p>
<p>The item, Dead Man's Boots, was last known to be in the possession of a necromancer named Nels Huto, who had left two weeks ago toward a fortress deep inside the Witchwood, and never returned.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] thanked [ENTITY:npc:Soranna], and then both she and [ENTITY:npc:Soranna] turned their attention back to [ENTITY:character:Olek] and the bald man, who introduced himself as Norro.</p>
<p>Norro was explaining to [ENTITY:character:Olek] the troubles the town faced - the raiders that kept attacking, how they had sent for help, and how fear was slowly creeping over their people. [ENTITY:character:Olek] told the old man about the "help" that had been sent - the three bodies they found at the farmhouse. Together with [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], they shared all the information they had gathered regarding the hobgoblins, the ambush, and the supposed warlord.</p>
<p>To their dismay, Wormlord Koth was not the warlord - he was merely a captain. Neither [ENTITY:npc:Soranna] nor Norro had ever heard of the "Day of Ruin" either, and could only guess that the raiders' base was somewhere deep in the Witchwood.</p>
<p>They did, however, offer a deal: stop as many raiders as possible, and a reward would be offered to each one in their group.</p>
<p>With the meeting concluded, and dusk starting to creep over the town, [ENTITY:character:Olek] summoned his trusty steed, lifting [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] up behind him, and together they rode toward the meeting point to reunite with the others.</p>

<h3>Norr and Soshi</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, not far across town, [ENTITY:character:Norr] and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] were making their own way toward the Shrine of Pelor, each carrying the weight of their own thoughts and a shared purpose.</p>
<p>The way to the shrine took the two ladies through the city's market. The bustling streets, the yelling vendors trying to convince passersby to buy their wares, the colorful multitude of fruits, vegetables, and other foods all convinced [ENTITY:character:Norr] and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] to slow their pace and enjoy the sights.</p>
<p>Since they were heading to a temple, an offering needed to be made - either gold, or a basket of goods. Both women were easily moved by people in unfortunate situations, especially knowing what they themselves had gone through.</p>
<p>It was, therefore, very hard for them not to stop and listen to every merchant who pleaded their case.</p>
<p>Soon enough, a small, old lady - frail, sweet, and sad-looking - convinced them to buy a small bundle of leafy greens for what seemed like a fair price: just five silver coins.</p>
<p>Happy with their good deed, the two friends continued on toward a fruit stand, where a young girl greeted them with a kind and honest smile. Her price for the fruits? Also five silver coins for one kilogram - curiously enough, the very same price as the handful of greens.</p>
<p>We could say the two girls were swindled out of their coin by a clever old woman... or we could pretend they simply did a good deed that day.</p>
<p>With their offerings in hand and a quiet satisfaction from their small acts of kindness, [ENTITY:character:Norr] and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] made their way through the bustling streets toward the Shrine of Pelor, the weight of the city's noise fading as they neared the small yet welcoming temple.</p>
<p>Inside the temple, two acolytes quickly approached to greet them. The women explained they wished to speak with Brother Denny and the druid Avartel. The two disciples hurried off to find them, leaving [ENTITY:character:Norr] and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] to wait. As they wandered further into the temple, they happened upon two men engaged in a deep, intense conversation.</p>
<p>Before they could make sense of the exchange, the acolytes returned, realizing they were no longer needed. With hurried apologies, they left, and the women were left with Brother Denny.</p>
<p>What happened next might be a bit unusual for those not familiar with shrines or temples. Brother Denny took the initiative, addressing the women with a warm but eager tone. "<span class="dialogue">How can I help you two? Did you come to make your confessions? Come now, bend your knees and tell Brother Denny what weighs on your soul.</span>"</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Norr], caught completely off guard by the sudden formality, blinked and took an exaggerated step forward, half-raising herself to kneel. It was almost as if she thought she should start confessing, completely confused by the situation. But before she could do anything more absurd, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] quickly cut in, catching Brother Denny's attention. "<span class="dialogue">We brought an offering!</span>" she blurted, rescuing them from the awkwardness. The words broke Brother Denny's trance, and he finally focused on the two women.</p>
<p>Brother Denny's enthusiasm visibly deflated when he saw that the offering was not in gold, but rather in fruits. He accepted the offering  without a second thought, and with a casual wave, he took the basket to a back room, likely for their intended use - though, one might suspect, the fruits would do little more than sustain the lifestyle of a certain priest.</p>
<p>Left alone with the druid Avartel, the two women hesitated for a moment before shyly bringing up the reason for their visit - the lake on the map, the one that might hold a treasure. Of course, they didn't share that detail with the druid, but they did inquire about the lake itself- how to reach it, and what dangers might lie along the way.</p>
<p>Avartel, ever kind, shared whatever information he had. He spoke of a fortress near the lake, deep within the Witchwood. The ground there was cursed, a blight that ruined everything in its path. The fortress was called Wrath Keep, and skeletons had been seen guarding the place.</p>
<p>There was little more he could tell them; he and the other druids avoided the area whenever they could, the dangers there too great to ignore.</p>
<p>Just as they were about to ask more, Brother Denny returned, quickly shifting the mood. He began to try and convince them to buy some of his wares. The two friends, slowly backing toward the exit, thanked both the druid and the priest before making their way to the meeting point.</p>

<h3>Kaedin</h3>

<p>While [ENTITY:character:Norr] and [ENTITY:character:Soshi] made their way to the shrine, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]'s steps led him through the winding streets toward the manor on the bluffs overlooking the river. The house of Sertieren, an old noble residence with an air of mystery, stood ahead. Its crumbling grandeur seemed to whisper of forgotten secrets, the windows dark and the reputation of its haunted halls ever present. As he drew closer to the house, he couldn't help but feel the weight of its history pressing against him.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] had seen his share of unusual things, but even he couldn't help but stop in his tracks when he stepped inside and heard the fountain speak.</p>
<p>"<span class="dialogue">Hello there! Could I offer you some tea?</span>" said the fountain to the fighter.</p>
<p>Frozen for a moment, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] wasn't sure how to react, so he simply stood there, waiting for the next move.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, a halfling appeared - middle-aged, with spectacles perched on his nose and a mane of grey-white hair. He echoed the fountain's question, his voice warm and casual, as if this were a perfectly normal occurrence.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] blinked, gathering his bearings. He quickly deduced that the mansion was infused with magic, no doubt from the wizard Sertieren himself. Of course the fountain could speak. With a steady breath, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] finally spoke up, his mind shifting gears. "<span class="dialogue">Perhaps something stronger? Do you have any spirits?</span>"</p>
<p>The halfling's eyes lit up with delight, and he scurried to a worktable nearby, seemingly pleased by the request. In no time, he returned with a glass of what could only loosely be described as rum - or something very close to it.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] began explaining why he had sought out the wizard, asking questions about mysterious magic, strange disappearances - anything that could offer a hint for his quest to find [ENTITY:npc:Thalos] and bring him home.</p>
<p>Sertieren, delighted to have a visitor to talk to, started rambling: he spoke of odd vanishings, though it was unclear if they were true or just the work of charlatans playing tricks. He muttered about the [ENTITY:guild:Krynn:Chronomancers of Krynn], how nine people had once gone to investigate them and nine had been killed by dragons - or so the rumors said. He mentioned a magical site, a nexus of some kind where these events were said to happen, though he couldn't say exactly where - probably somewhere deep within the Witchwood.</p>
<p>Before long, Sertieren drifted into complaining about how people had called him mad, paranoid, whenever he urged them to strengthen the city's defenses... and now, he said with a grim satisfaction, danger had come to [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry] again.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] listened quietly, filing away the important pieces of information in his mind, slowly sipping the rum Sertieren had provided.</p>
<p>At last, realizing Sertieren had no more real answers - only half-truths and rumors - [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] drained the last of his drink and took his leave with a brief, tight nod. The manor's heavy door creaked shut behind him, and he stood for a moment at the edge of the bluffs, the wind off the river cold against his face. Somewhere out there, [ENTITY:npc:Thalos] was still missing.</p>
<p>Setting his jaw, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] pulled his cloak tighter and turned back toward the town, each step measured, purposeful, as he made his way to the meeting point to rejoin the others.</p>
