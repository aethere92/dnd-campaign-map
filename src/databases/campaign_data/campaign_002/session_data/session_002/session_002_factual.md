<h3><strong>II. Narrative Summary (The Bullet Points)</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>While traveling to Drellin's Ferry, the party was ambushed by hobgoblins at a ruined farmhouse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They fought off the attackers with impressive teamwork, defeating a hobgoblin captain through a combined assault from Norr, Soshi, Kaedin, Olek, and Bonnie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One hobgoblin was captured and interrogated. Under a <em>Zone of Truth</em>, he revealed the name of his leader, "Wyrmlord Koth," and a plan called the "Day of Ruin" in exchange for a swift death, a promise Olek fulfilled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among the belongings of three dead travelers found at the site, the party discovered a strange symbol: a sun with a red hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuing towards town, Olek attempted to warn a farmer and his sons of the danger, but his aasimar appearance terrified them. Bonnie&rsquo;s telepathic "Boo" sent the family fleeing, abandoning their cart, from which she pilfered some wine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The party arrived at Drellin's Ferry, a town with five new watchtowers. They spoke with Sergeant Hersk, who confirmed other recent raider attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The party split up to pursue individual leads:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Olek and Bonnie encountered a young boy who asked for help for his abused mother. They met the mother, Olek healed her, and they promised to return the next day to confront the father.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the tollhouse, Bonnie secretly delivered a package to Captain Soranna, receiving a quest to find an artifact called the Dead Man's Boots. They also spoke with an elder, Norro, about the raider threat and were hired to help protect the town.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Norr and Soshi visited the Shrine of Pelor. They met the eccentric Brother Denny and a helpful druid, Avarthel, who told them of a cursed fortress called Wrath Keep, guarded by skeletons, located near the lake on their map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kaedin visited the wizard Sertieren to ask about his missing person, Thalos. Sertieren spoke of the Chronomancers of Krynn and a magical nexus deep within the Witchwood.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As dusk fell, the separated party members began making their way to a pre-arranged meeting point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
