	BONNIE: {
		background: `<p>So far, we've heard tales of lost families, fractured selves, and friends long gone - of longings for magic, regrets for what once was, and hopes for what could be. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], however, is not like that.</p>
		<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] is a fairy pixie born from the pure magic of the [ENTITY:location:Feywilds]. She had no real family - other fairies born like her could be considered one, but she never saw it that way. She had no home beyond trees and groves, caves and lakes. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] lived her long life doing whatever she pleased, always with her trusted companion, friend, and what she would call family: [ENTITY:npc:Jacques], the antlered giant rat.</p>
		<p>Pixies are known to be a little mischievous, but rarely with a truly mean bone in them. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], however, seems to have that particular trait in spades. She found joy in rule-breaking, in taking what wasn't hers. She enjoyed doing what she wanted, when she wanted, and nothing - absolutely nothing - could stand in her way.</p>
		<p>But ah, what [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] did not anticipate was that fate had plans for her, too. One lovely morning, while dodging a swarm of angry Summer Court Sprites, she ran headfirst into someone who had no business being this deep in the [ENTITY:location:Feywilds] - a Quickling by the name of [ENTITY:npc:Clyde]. Now, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] didn't care for rules, and instead of reporting the trespasser, she befriended him.</p>
		<p>In time, the two caused a storm of chaos together. They broke rules, borrowed (as they called it) treasures, stirred up trouble wherever they went. Their lives were fast and bright, a whirlwind of trouble and laughter - until the consequences finally caught up.</p>
		<p>[ENTITY:npc:Clyde] was captured by the Sprites and dragged before Queen Titania herself. A spy, they claimed. Sent by the twisted Winter Queen. The sentence was swift: execution.</p>
		<p>What [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] never expected in her long, chaotic life was to care for someone other than [ENTITY:npc:Jacques]. But she did. So, she stepped forward, confessed to everything in a desperate attempt to save her friend.</p>
		<p>[ENTITY:npc:Clyde] was spared. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] was not. Exiled to the mortal plane, cut off from the [ENTITY:location:Feywilds], with no way back. [ENTITY:npc:Clyde] was gone. Magic was... different now.</p>
		<p>But [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] was scrappy. She carved out a life in [ENTITY:location:Brindol], adapted to the strange new shape of her magic, and stayed close to [ENTITY:npc:Jacques] - even if he was quite a bit smaller now than he once was. She spent her time with the Thieves' Guild, either waiting for something better to come along or searching for a way back home.</p>
		<p>And maybe, just maybe, that something finally did.</p>
		<p>On an errand to reach [ENTITY:location:Drellin\'s Ferry], [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] finds herself traveling with four odd companions, and while she brings trouble and pranks to their lives, she also watches their backs in her own special way.</p>`,
		shortDescription: `Bonnie is a mischievous pixie from the Feywilds who never cared for rules-only freedom, fun, and her beloved companion, Jacques the giant rat. But after befriending a reckless Quickling named Clyde and getting caught in Fey court politics, she was exiled to the mortal world to save him. Now stuck in Brindol, smaller in magic but no less scrappy, Bonnie works with the Thieves' Guild and stirs up trouble wherever she goes. Sent on an errand to Drellin's Ferry, she travels with four unlikely companions-bringing chaos, charm, and unexpected loyalty to the road ahead.`,

	KAEDIN: {
		background: `<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] was born in the mining village of Grackledorn, carved into the rugged ridges of the Earthspur Mountains near the edge of the Great Rift. The land there thrummed with old power, remnants of a time when a mighty Dao genie once struck a pact with the mountain dwarves, leaving the region steeped in latent elemental magic. Though his parents were human, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]'s body and soul were forever marked by this place-born of stone and thunder, forged in silence and shifting earth. </p>

        <p>As a child, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] was clever, energetic, and always on the verge of mischief. His constant partner in trouble was [ENTITY:npc:Thalos], the son of stoic, deeply religious Earth Genasi parents who upheld every tradition with unwavering reverence. [ENTITY:npc:Thalos] always wore his people's ceremonial robes, stiff with cultural pride and stitched with sacred patterns of stone. [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] mocked them at first-he found them impractical, absurd for cave diving and running through the hills. But [ENTITY:npc:Thalos] never cared what [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] thought; he wore them because they meant something.</p>

        <p>One fateful day, at only ten years old, the two friends ventured into a newly revealed tunnel in the cliffs beyond the village. The air inside was sharp with arcane charge, and the walls glittered with strange, glowing crystal veins. In the heart of that cave, they found an ancient monolith-a beacon of pure energy, covered in glowing symbols [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] would one day recognize as belonging to the Kryn Dynasty.</p>

        <p>Their laughter and arguing masked the danger until it was too late. A pressure plate clicked beneath [ENTITY:npc:Thalos]'s foot, and the beacon flared to life. Dunamis energy surged through the cavern, and before [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] could act, [ENTITY:npc:Thalos] was consumed by the pulse-his form collapsing into a shimmer of light before vanishing entirely. Only his robes remained, crumpled on the stone floor. The village assumed [ENTITY:npc:Thalos] had been lost in a cave-in. But [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] knew the truth: something had taken his friend beyond the boundaries of their world. </p>
        
        <p>In the months that followed, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] began to experience disturbing visions. He would seize up with piercing headaches, and during those moments, the world seemed to warp-reflections of himself flickered across the edges of his sight, and time stuttered like a skipped breath. He saw himself fighting battles he hadn't lived, speaking words he'd never learned. He was seeing alternate versions of his life-echoes.</p>

        <p>Desperate for answers, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] eventually traveled east, following rumors of Kryn exiles who had continued their study of dunamancy in secret. In the shadowy tunnels beneath Velkynvelve, he found them-arcane researchers, deserters, and mystics. One of them, a wizened mage named Verenn Yorr, recognized the potential in [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]'s unstable visions and offered to help.
        Under Verenn's guidance, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] learned to harness the rifts within himself. He trained to stabilize the echoes and turn them into extensions of his will-shadows of himself pulled from other timelines, weapons shaped from the possibilities of his own existence.</p>
		
		<p>With discipline and will, he became something new: an Echo Knight, a warrior with one foot planted in every version of reality.
        [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] joined a soldier's company not long after, hoping to gain the discipline and experience to master his strange powers. But he never stopped searching. He wore [ENTITY:npc:Thalos]'s traditional Earth Genasi robes over his armor, adapting them to his style: long black cloaks with golden trims, chainmail hidden beneath flowing earthen fabric. The other soldiers mocked his appearance, seeing only a mystic trying to play at being a knight. That laughter quickly died on the training grounds.</p>

		<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] never tried to correct their assumptions. He remained quiet, direct, and solitary. Many mistook his reserved nature for a lack of charisma, but [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] had long since abandoned social rituals. Every word, every action, was weighed for purpose. He did not fight for glory or gold-he fought to control the powers of fate, to learn how to step through time itself, and to find the one timeline where [ENTITY:npc:Thalos] still lived.</p>

        <p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] had been tracing reports of arcane disturbances-instances where individuals claimed to have seen visions of themselves acting out moments that hadn't yet occurred. Whispers of these strange anomalies led him west, to the Elsir Vale, a land scattered with ruins of ancient civilizations and known for its thin veil between worlds. Rumors in Dennovar spoke of a ruined fortress to the north where the walls shimmered at night and shadows moved without a source.</p>

        <p>He arrived in [ENTITY:location:Brindol], the Vale's largest city, under the guise of a wandering soldier-scholar, seeking tomes and local accounts of planar rifts. His presence, though quiet, didn't go unnoticed for long.</p>

        <p>When goblin raids intensified, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] stepped in to defend a merchant caravan during a sudden ambush. His command of echo magic-blinking in and out of reality, fighting alongside his own shadows-left survivors stunned. Word of the strange warrior reached Lord Jarmaath of [ENTITY:location:Brindol], who was desperate for capable allies as tensions in the region worsened.</p>

        <p>Their agreement was simple: [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] would scout the threat in the wilds surrounding [ENTITY:location:Brindol], confirm the reports of a united goblinoid force, identify the warlord behind it, and uncover what their endgame was.</p>

        <p>But for [ENTITY:character:Kaedin], there was more to it than a mission. He had heard rumors that the warlord, used strange tactics-ambushes that unfolded like they had foreseen their enemies' every move. It could have been coincidence. Or it could be another sign of dunamancy at work.</p>`,
		shortDescription: `Kaedin, an Echo Knight born near the Great Rift, was marked by ancient elemental magic despite his human lineage. After losing his childhood friend Thalos to a mysterious dunamis beacon, Kaedin began experiencing visions of alternate selves. His search for answers led him to secret Kryn mystics, where he learned to control his echoes. Now a stoic, battle-hardened warrior draped in Thalos's Genasi robes, Kaedin travels the Elsir Vale, hunting signs of temporal magic-hoping to master fate and find the timeline where his friend still lives.`,

	OLEK: {
		background: `<p>He is devotion given form - an angelic soul clad in armor, kind and just, friendly and ever ready for conversation. [ENTITY:character:Olek] is honorable to his very core, though humble in his ways, never one to boast or seek glory.</p>

		<p>His story is unlike any other. As a child, he and his sibling were raised not by kin of their own kind, but by wolves, deep within the forest. How they came to be there, he cannot say. The memory is lost to time or fate. But the pack was family, and he knew love in fur and fang.</p>

		<p>Then came the day of fire and chaos - a savage raid by orcs, goblins, and fouler things still. In the desperate struggle, his pack urged the siblings to flee. In the confusion, they were separated. [ENTITY:character:Olek] wandered for days beneath the trees, searching for his family, for his brother or sister, for anyone.</p>

		<p>And then, when all hope seemed lost, fate intervened. A celestial being descended - radiant and awe-inspiring, not Helm himself but a servant of his will, a divine entity bound closely to the God of Guardians. With a voice like distant thunder wrapped in warmth, the being offered [ENTITY:character:Olek] a pact, with one charge: <strong>Help as many as you can. Save those in need. Whatever you may do, walk forward with the teachings of our Father. Never stray. Never falter.</strong></p>

		<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek] accepted.</p>

		<p>He reached the town of [ENTITY:location:Brindol], where he offered help wherever it was needed. He stood beside other paladins of Helm, worked to defend the weak, and forged both likely and unlikely bonds. And now, he finds himself walking beside four others, toward the distant town of [ENTITY:location:Drellin\'s Ferry], with justice and goodness lighting his path.</p>

		<p>Whatever awaits them there, [ENTITY:character:Olek] walks forward with purpose - for the lost, for the helpless, for the ideals he now embodies.</p>`,
		shortDescription:
			"Raised by wolves and bound by a divine pact, Olek is a humble paladin devoted to justice and compassion. Separated from his sibling during a brutal raid, he was saved by a celestial servant of Helm and charged with a sacred duty: protect the helpless and walk the path of righteousness without falter. Now, Olek travels toward Drellin's Ferry alongside four companions, a steady light in darkening times-guided by honor, heart, and the will of the Guardian.",

	SOSHI: {
		background: `<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi] was not born in the world of mortals. As all fey creatures do, she was born in the [ENTITY:location:Feywilds] - magic giving her shape and form, infusing her with the changing seasons.</p>

		<p>By now, we know that fate plays a hand in the lives of all beings. Some say she wandered too close to a thin place in the weave, others whisper she was drawn through by the echoes of something calling her. Whatever the cause, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] crossed into the Material Plane as a child, stepping through unseen doors and emerging into the harsh, unforgiving port city of [ENTITY:location:Luskan].</p>

		<p>Alone, alien, and stripped of the familiar cadence of fey life, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] learned quickly that her joyful magic and dreamlike presence were of little use in this place. Life among mortals was different - here, power was survival, and magic was currency.</p>

		<p>Slowly, desire crawled through the cracks left by doubt and a wavering sense of self. Slowly, it made her forget what she was, where she came from, and what magic was supposed to be.</p>

		<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi] buried herself in books. Arcane formulas, incantations, the elegant structure of wizardry - she consumed it all with the desperation of someone who had everything to prove. In time, her dedication was noticed. The [ENTITY:guild:Arcane Brotherhood], ever in search of useful minds, extended a hand. Desperate to belong, desperate to be powerful, she took it.</p>

		<p>But by now, we also know the [ENTITY:guild:Arcane Brotherhood:Brotherhood] isn't a place of fairytales. Its dark, twisted secrets came to light, terrifying [ENTITY:character:Soshi] - reminding her that some prices are too high to pay.</p>

		<p>And so, together with the only friend she managed to make in this unforgiving world, she stole a map - a way for them to survive in the wide, dangerous world beyond.</p>

		<p>Driven by regrets, desires, and ambition, longing for home and the joyful life she left behind, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] finds herself traveling with four other companions: her friend from the [ENTITY:guild:Arcane Brotherhood:Brotherhood], and three others as different as night is from day.</p>

		<p>And so, we find [ENTITY:character:Soshi], her spellbook in hand and memories of the [ENTITY:location:Feywilds] stirring in her chest, walking the winding road to [ENTITY:location:Drellin\'s Ferry].</p>`,
		shortDescription:
			"Born of magic in the Feywilds, Soshi crossed into the harsh world of mortals as a child, lost and alone in the unforgiving streets of Luskan. Stripped of her fey joy, she buried herself in wizardry, desperate to belong. The Arcane Brotherhood gave her power-but at a terrible cost. Fleeing its darkness with her only friend and a stolen map, Soshi now travels toward Drellin's Ferry with a band of unlikely allies, her spellbook in hand and the echo of the Feywild still stirring in her soul.",

	NORR: {
		background: `<p>[ENTITY:character:Norr], like so many other gifted children born into this world, did not have an easy start in life. Born into a poor family, with a father who enjoyed his drink a bit too much, and a mother unable to defend herself or her daughter, [ENTITY:character:Norr] learned early to keep quiet and keep to herself.</p>

		<p>She was beautiful, even as a child, and a strange, mysterious energy seemed to surround her. Drawing attention was never ideal - especially not in a household like hers. Her parents, frightened and unsure of what she was becoming, kept her gifts hidden from the world.</p>

		<p>As fate often does, it intervened on a stormy, rain-soaked night. While searching for shelter from the downpour, [ENTITY:character:Norr] stumbled upon a terrible scene: a fair Lady, beset by bandits. [ENTITY:character:Norr] panicked, frozen in fear, uncertain of how to help. But then, in a flash of lightning everything shifted.</p>

		<p>The lady was never truly in danger. Magic poured out of her in powerful waves, and the bandits stood no chance.</p>

		<p>Awestruck, [ENTITY:character:Norr] stepped closer, throwing caution to the wind. There was something familiar between them - something felt rather than seen. They were alike, somehow. They both knew it.</p>

		<p>The lady introduced herself as [ENTITY:npc:Zella], and she listened - truly listened - to [ENTITY:character:Norr]'s story. Her struggles, her fears, the confusion that had shadowed her life. And then [ENTITY:npc:Zella] made an offer: to take [ENTITY:character:Norr] under her wing and teach her the ways of magic.</p>

		<p>It was a painful decision. To leave her family and everything she had known behind, or to remain and live forever as only half of herself. But the excitement - the longing to understand what she was - overwhelmed her doubt. She went with [ENTITY:npc:Zella].</p>

		<p>They spent years together. [ENTITY:npc:Zella] taught her everything she knew, drilled every bit of magical knowledge into [ENTITY:character:Norr]'s mind. When there was nothing left to teach, she sent her student onward - to [ENTITY:location:Luskan], to find the [ENTITY:guild:Arcane Brotherhood]. A place of boundless learning, where the magically gifted could find their path. A place, perhaps, to belong.</p>

		<p>[ENTITY:character:Norr] joined the [ENTITY:guild:Arcane Brotherhood:Brotherhood] but soon discovered that great institutions often hide terrible secrets. Together with a friend she made within its walls, she uncovered one such secret - a map leading to a great treasure. And together, they fled. The road led them to [ENTITY:location:Brindol].</p>

		<p>And so, we find [ENTITY:character:Norr] now, her secrets held tight behind guarded eyes, the stolen map close to her heart. Beside her walks her dearest companion, and three strange allies whose paths are now twined with hers. Together they journey to [ENTITY:location:Drellin\'s Ferry].</p>

		<p>The future, like magic, is uncertain. But [ENTITY:character:Norr] walks forward - beautiful, dangerous, and full of lightning.</p>`,
		shortDescription:
			"Norr was born into hardship-an unloved child with hidden power and a storm in her soul. Discovered by a mysterious sorceress named Zella, she was offered a way out: a life of magic, purpose, and freedom. Years of mentorship led her to the Arcane Brotherhood, but the institution's dark truths soon drove her away. With a stolen map and her closest friend at her side, Norr now travels toward Drellin's Ferry with a new band of companions. Guarded, graceful, and brimming with untapped power, she walks into an uncertain future-beautiful, dangerous, and full of lightning.",
