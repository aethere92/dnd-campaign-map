The town is aware of nearby dangers and faces coordinated raider attacks. At the spot where the Dawn Way crosses the River Elsir stands the small town of Drellin's Ferry, once known as Dwarfbridge. As the old name implies, long ago the Elsir was spanned by a sturdy dwarf-made bridge at this spot, but a hundred years ago the bridge washed out in a great flood. An enterprising man named Drellin hammered together a small horse-drawn ferry to maintain a river crossing here, and a town eventually grew up around the enterprise.",
