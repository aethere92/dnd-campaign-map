<h3>The beginnings</h3>
<p>The story of our five heroes begins, as many do, on a road leading toward a town.</p>
<p>But this is no well-traveled path of cobblestones and dust - instead, it winds through a thick tangle of knee-high weeds and scattered trees, draped in the vibrant green of a subtropical forest. The air is heavy with the scent of life and growth, and the sound of distant creatures echoes beneath the canopy.</p>
<p>Our heroes are quite the unlikely bunch - a rare mix of races and origins - but they travel together in good spirits, friendly and merry, sharing tales and learning more of one another with each step.</p>
<p>They have met before, here and there. Once or twice as allies, perhaps once or twice as obstacles to each other's paths. Yet none of that seems to matter now. Whatever reasons brought them together - whether shared cause or secret ambition - they move forward as one, at least for now.</p>
<p>Now, one by one, let us see who they are.</p>

<p><h3>[ENTITY:character:Olek], the Aasimar [ENTITY:class:Paladin] of Helm</h3></p>

<p>He is devotion given form - an angelic soul clad in armor, kind and just, friendly and ever ready for conversation. [ENTITY:character:Olek] is honorable to his very core, though humble in his ways, never one to boast or seek glory.</p>
<p>His story is unlike any other. As a child, he and his sibling were raised not by kin of their own kind, but by wolves, deep within the forest. How they came to be there, he cannot say. The memory is lost to time or fate. But the pack was family, and he knew love in fur and fang.</p>
<p>Then came the day of fire and chaos - a savage raid by orcs, goblins, and fouler things still. In the desperate struggle, his pack urged the siblings to flee. In the confusion, they were separated. [ENTITY:character:Olek] wandered for days beneath the trees, searching for his family, for his brother or sister, for anyone.</p>
<p>And then, when all hope seemed lost, fate intervened. A celestial being descended - radiant and awe-inspiring, not Helm himself but a servant of his will, a divine entity bound closely to the God of Guardians. With a voice like distant thunder wrapped in warmth, the being offered [ENTITY:character:Olek] a pact, with one charge: <strong>Help as many as you can. Save those in need. Whatever you may do, walk forward with the teachings of our Father. Never stray. Never falter.</strong></p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Olek] accepted.</p>
<p>He reached the town of [ENTITY:location:Brindol], where he offered help wherever it was needed. He stood beside other paladins of Helm, worked to defend the weak, and forged both likely and unlikely bonds. And now, he finds himself walking beside four others, toward the distant town of [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry], with justice and goodness lighting his path.</p>
<p>Whatever awaits them there, [ENTITY:character:Olek] walks forward with purpose - for the lost, for the helpless, for the ideals he now embodies.</p>

<p><h3>[ENTITY:character:Norr], the [ENTITY:class:Sorcerer] with Dragon's Blood</h3></p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Norr], like so many other gifted children born into this world, did not have an easy start in life. Born into a poor family, with a father who enjoyed his drink a bit too much, and a mother unable to defend herself or her daughter, [ENTITY:character:Norr] learned early to keep quiet and keep to herself.</p>
<p>She was beautiful, even as a child, and a strange, mysterious energy seemed to surround her. Drawing attention was never ideal - especially not in a household like hers. Her parents, frightened and unsure of what she was becoming, kept her gifts hidden from the world.</p>
<p>As fate often does, it intervened on a stormy, rain-soaked night. While searching for shelter from the downpour, [ENTITY:character:Norr] stumbled upon a terrible scene: a fair Lady, beset by bandits. [ENTITY:character:Norr] panicked, frozen in fear, uncertain of how to help. But then, in a flash of lightning everything shifted.</p>
<p>The lady was never truly in danger. Magic poured out of her in powerful waves, and the bandits stood no chance.</p>
<p>Awestruck, [ENTITY:character:Norr] stepped closer, throwing caution to the wind. There was something familiar between them - something felt rather than seen. They were alike, somehow. They both knew it.</p>
<p>The lady introduced herself as [ENTITY:npc:Zella], and she listened - truly listened - to [ENTITY:character:Norr]'s story. Her struggles, her fears, the confusion that had shadowed her life. And then [ENTITY:npc:Zella] made an offer: to take [ENTITY:character:Norr] under her wing and teach her the ways of magic.</p>
<p>It was a painful decision. To leave her family and everything she had known behind, or to remain and live forever as only half of herself. But the excitement - the longing to understand what she was - overwhelmed her doubt. She went with [ENTITY:npc:Zella].</p>
<p>They spent years together. [ENTITY:npc:Zella] taught her everything she knew, drilled every bit of magical knowledge into [ENTITY:character:Norr]'s mind. When there was nothing left to teach, she sent her student onward - to [ENTITY:location:Luskan], to find the [ENTITY:faction:The Arcane Brotherhood]. A place of boundless learning, where the magically gifted could find their path. A place, perhaps, to belong.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Norr] joined the [ENTITY:faction:The Arcane Brotherhood:Brotherhood] but soon discovered that great institutions often hide terrible secrets. Together with a friend she made within its walls, she uncovered one such secret - a map leading to a great treasure. And together, they fled. The road led them to [ENTITY:location:Brindol].</p>
<p>And so, we find [ENTITY:character:Norr] now, her secrets held tight behind guarded eyes, the stolen map close to her heart. Beside her walks her dearest companion, and three strange allies whose paths are now twined with hers. Together they journey to [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry].</p>
<p>The future, like magic, is uncertain. But [ENTITY:character:Norr] walks forward - beautiful, dangerous, and full of lightning.</p>

<p><h3>[ENTITY:character:Soshi], the Eladrin [ENTITY:class:Wizard] from the [ENTITY:location:Feywilds]</h3></p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi] was not born in the world of mortals. As all fey creatures do, she was born in the [ENTITY:location:feywild:Feywilds] - magic giving her shape and form, infusing her with the changing seasons.</p>
<p>By now, we know that fate plays a hand in the lives of all beings. Some say she wandered too close to a thin place in the weave, others whisper she was drawn through by the echoes of something calling her. Whatever the cause, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] crossed into the Material Plane as a child, stepping through unseen doors and emerging into the harsh, unforgiving port city of [ENTITY:location:Luskan].</p>
<p>Alone, alien, and stripped of the familiar cadence of fey life, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] learned quickly that her joyful magic and dreamlike presence were of little use in this place. Life among mortals was different - here, power was survival, and magic was currency.</p>
<p>Slowly, desire crawled through the cracks left by doubt and a wavering sense of self. Slowly, it made her forget what she was, where she came from, and what magic was supposed to be.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Soshi] buried herself in books. Arcane formulas, incantations, the elegant structure of wizardry - she consumed it all with the desperation of someone who had everything to prove. In time, her dedication was noticed. The [ENTITY:faction:The Arcane Brotherhood], ever in search of useful minds, extended a hand. Desperate to belong, desperate to be powerful, she took it.</p>
<p>But by now, we also know the [ENTITY:faction:The Arcane Brotherhood:Brotherhood] isn't a place of fairytales. Its dark, twisted secrets came to light, terrifying [ENTITY:character:Soshi] - reminding her that some prices are too high to pay.</p>
<p>And so, together with the only friend she managed to make in this unforgiving world, she stole a map - a way for them to survive in the wide, dangerous world beyond.</p>
<p>Driven by regrets, desires, and ambition, longing for home and the joyful life she left behind, [ENTITY:character:Soshi] finds herself traveling with four other companions: her friend from the [ENTITY:faction:The Arcane Brotherhood:Brotherhood], and three others as different as night is from day.</p>
<p>And so, we find [ENTITY:character:Soshi], her spellbook in hand and memories of the [ENTITY:location:feywild:Feywilds] stirring in her chest, walking the winding road to [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry].</p>

<p><h3>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin], the [ENTITY:race:Earth Genasi] [ENTITY:subclass:Echo Knight] of the Shifting Fates</h3></p>

<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] was an unusual child in a very usual family. Born out of humans, in a small mining village blessed by a Dao genie, he lived a simple life. Clever, full of energy, and with trouble always finding him, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] enjoyed his days, finding excitement in what others would consider mundane.</p>
<p>He became fast friends with [ENTITY:npc:Thalos], the son of a deeply religious [ENTITY:race:Earth Genasi] family. They couldn't have been more different - [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] scoffed at tradition, finding it impractical, while [ENTITY:npc:Thalos] honored it in every word, every piece of clothing, every step. But their souls were alike, and together they spent their days chasing adventure, uncovering secrets, and exploring hidden tunnels.</p>
<p>As we've become accustomed, fate decided to meddle once more. During their daily search for excitement, they discovered a new tunnel. Of course, giddy and chatty and bickering, they delved in with no caution taken, no trap detected - because what could go wrong in such a simple village?</p>
<p>[ENTITY:npc:Thalos] stepped onto a pressure plate.</p>
<p>That's all it took to shatter [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]'s life. That's all it took for him to lose his friend - for him to almost lose himself.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:npc:Thalos] was nowhere to be found. Assumed dead by the village, with only his traditional garb left behind.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] never gave up. He looked for him. He was sure his friend had been taken somewhere.</p>
<p>As time passed, strange things started happening to [ENTITY:character:Kaedin]. Terrible visions would show themselves to him, accompanied by excruciating headaches. He could see himself living a thousand lives, fighting a hundred battles, speaking tongues he had never heard before. He understood - whatever took his friend gave him visions of his alternate lives.</p>
<p>But through it all, he knew - whatever had taken [ENTITY:npc:Thalos] had left something in him. A connection. A thread.</p>
<p>And where there is a thread, there is a trail.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Kaedin] left his village, left his life behind. He looked for answers in the only place he could think of - the shadowy tunnels where exiles lived. Among them, he found one that would speak with him: a wizened mage by the name of Verenn Yorr. Verenn found that he could help [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] master his new abilities, trained him in combat while teaching him how to harness his visions and use them to his own will.</p>
<p>When all teachings were done, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] adventured into the world. He joined a company of soldiers, learned what he could from them. But he never forgot. His friend was still out there, waiting to be found.</p>
<p>In memory of [ENTITY:npc:Thalos], no matter what he wore, [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] always donned the traditional garb over. This way he would never forget. This way he would never stop looking.</p>
<p>And now we find [ENTITY:character:Kaedin] on the road to [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry], walking beside four unlikely companions. He keeps his past close and his mission closer - his eyes on the path ahead, and his soul reaching for the one left behind.</p>

<p><h3>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie], the Pixie [ENTITY:class:Rogue] full of mischief</h3></p>

<p>Here we are - our fifth hero. So far, we've heard tales of lost families, fractured selves, and friends long gone - of longings for magic, regrets for what once was, and hopes for what could be. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], however, is not like that.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:character:Bonnie] is a fairy pixie born from the pure magic of the [ENTITY:location:feywild:Feywilds]. She had no real family - other fairies born like her could be considered one, but she never saw it that way. She had no home beyond trees and groves, caves and lakes. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] lived her long life doing whatever she pleased, always with her trusted companion, friend, and what she would call family: [ENTITY:npc:Jacques], the antlered giant rat.</p>
<p>Pixies are known to be a little mischievous, but rarely with a truly mean bone in them. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie], however, seems to have that particular trait in spades. She found joy in rule-breaking, in taking what wasn't hers. She enjoyed doing what she wanted, when she wanted, and nothing - absolutely nothing - could stand in her way.</p>
<p>But ah, what [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] did not anticipate was that fate had plans for her, too. One lovely morning, while dodging a swarm of angry Summer Court Sprites, she ran headfirst into someone who had no business being this deep in the [ENTITY:location:feywild:Feywilds] - a Quickling by the name of [ENTITY:npc:Clyde]. Now, [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] didn't care for rules, and instead of reporting the trespasser, she befriended him.</p>
<p>In time, the two caused a storm of chaos together. They broke rules, borrowed (as they called it) treasures, stirred up trouble wherever they went. Their lives were fast and bright, a whirlwind of trouble and laughter - until the consequences finally caught up.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:npc:Clyde] was captured by the Sprites and dragged before Queen Titania herself. A spy, they claimed. Sent by the twisted Winter Queen. The sentence was swift: execution.</p>
<p>What [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] never expected in her long, chaotic life was to care for someone other than [ENTITY:npc:Jacques]. But she did. So, she stepped forward, confessed to everything in a desperate attempt to save her friend.</p>
<p>[ENTITY:npc:Clyde] was spared. [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] was not. Exiled to the mortal plane, cut off from the [ENTITY:location:feywild:Feywilds], with no way back. [ENTITY:npc:Clyde] was gone. Magic was... different now.</p>
<p>But [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] was scrappy. She carved out a life in [ENTITY:location:Brindol], adapted to the strange new shape of her magic, and stayed close to [ENTITY:npc:Jacques] - even if he was quite a bit smaller now than he once was. She spent her time with the Thieves' faction, either waiting for something better to come along or searching for a way back home.</p>
<p>And maybe, just maybe, that something finally did.</p>
<p>On an errand to reach [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry], [ENTITY:character:Bonnie] finds herself traveling with four odd companions, and while she brings trouble and pranks to their lives, she also watches their backs in her own special way.</p>

<p>[IMAGE:images/assets/campaign_002/locations/drellin_ferry.jpg::300px::true]Here we are at last, on the way to [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry] with a crew of misfits - five people, all chasing something that might fulfill their hopes and dreams, or simply trying to stop the world from unraveling.</p>
<p>Now that we're all caught up with our heroes' stories, let's see what happened on the road to [ENTITY:location:Drellin's Ferry]!  </p>
