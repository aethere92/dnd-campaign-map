</ul>

<h3>II. Narrative Summary</h3>
<p><strong>The Cavern of Horrors</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The party emerged from the tunnels into a massive cavern filled with cages reinforced by dark magic, containing dozens of skulls (humanoid, reptilian, and unknown creatures).</li>
	<li>Norr identified remnants of a powerful ritual: burned reagents, shattered crystals, and magical residue indicating a recent ceremony.</li>
	<li>Adjacent chamber contained makeshift barracks for roughly 20 soldiers; weapons missing, area long abandoned.</li>
	<li>One tent contained arcane materials and books on alteration/transmutation. Kaedin recovered a half-burned ledger, partially obscured by magical wards.</li>
	<li>Decipherable entries revealed:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>All combatants had completed &ldquo;arena trials.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>A figure named Kilgor was collecting them.</li>
		<li>Mentions of &ldquo;the brotherhood&rdquo; failing to send reinforcements.</li>
		<li>Suspicion of three harpy spies sent by Kilgor.</li>
		<li>Plans to deliver all creatures to Kilgor to win the &ldquo;Festival of Life.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>Notes about traveling to Luskan via pirates, leaving treasure behind at &ldquo;the old fort north of the woods.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>Signed by Kalistra of the Brotherhood.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Norr recognized Kalistra as her former teacher&mdash;an alteration specialist known for &ldquo;mind spiking&rdquo; students. She left the Brotherhood 10 years prior.</li>
	<li>Attempting to read the obscured text revealed an illusion script ward, potentially harmful to bypass. Norr chose not to risk it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Giant Mosquitoes and Glowing Crystals</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Large, mosquito-like insects (female, blood-feeding) were found clinging to luminous crystals throughout the cavern.</li>
	<li>Crystals emitted various hues: white, yellow, and purple&mdash;functions unclear.</li>
	<li>The party refrained from disturbing them.</li>
	<li>Detect Magic revealed strong Conjuration energy near the ritual site, suggesting a summoning or transportation spell.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Encounter with the Megatherium</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The party traveled deeper, encountering massive sloth-bear-like creatures&mdash;Megatherium&mdash;roughly 8 feet tall.</li>
	<li>Olek&rsquo;s Divine Sense confirmed they were natural, not fiendish.</li>
	<li>Norr identified them (taking 3 psychic damage from a &ldquo;mind spike&rdquo; flashback to Kalistra&rsquo;s lessons).</li>
	<li>Megatherium traits: prehistoric, crossbred beasts resistant to fear/stun, primarily herbivorous but drawn to insect prey.</li>
	<li>Noted Broken Shackle Tribe markings&mdash;creatures likely tamed by orcs in the past.</li>
	<li>Bonnie successfully befriended two Megatherium, naming them Gică and Mișu.<strong><br /></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Underwater Passage</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Chamber led to an underground lake; at its bottom lay the remains of a ship&rsquo;s prow (~90 ft deep).</li>
	<li>The tunnel continued underwater; swimming looked dangerous.</li>
	<li>Bonnie persuaded the Megatherium to follow and assist the group in exploring further.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Spider Ambush</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Ambushed by Arthropleura fersanguinus (&ldquo;Spitters&rdquo;)&mdash;giant millipede-like creatures with acidic blood.</li>
	<li>Norr suffered another mind spike when recalling her training.</li>
	<li>Traits: simple-minded, part of the Te Snatchers goblin clan, acidic blood that damaged armor and splashed on attackers.</li>
	<li>Combat Highlights:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Norr unleashed large-scale fire spells.</li>
		<li>Kaedin used his Sacred Weapon ability for radiant attacks.</li>
		<li>Olek&rsquo;s armor and shield melted under acid exposure.</li>
		<li>The Megatherium turned feral against the insectoids&mdash;Mișu gained a combat buff (double speed, bonus attacks) after killing one.</li>
		<li>Bonnie fought from Mișu&rsquo;s back, dual-wielding daggers.</li>
		<li>Dridder-like commanders coordinated the ambush but were ultimately defeated.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Aftermath: victory achieved, but the party was heavily damaged, armor partially destroyed, and clothes degraded.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treasure and Toxins</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Post-battle loot and discoveries:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Harvested Arthropleura venom and useful alchemical materials.</li>
		<li>Found 10 Garlic Agaricoms&mdash;toxic mushrooms used to craft King&rsquo;s Blood Venom (paralyzing poison).</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Bonnie communicated with Gică and Mișu, learning their previous handlers (from the Broken Shackle tribe) had left two weeks earlier, answering &ldquo;the call of the Red Hand.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Pirate Ship</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The party followed the tunnels and reunited with Vandal and the Summoner, who were freeing a partially submerged pirate ship lodged in a cavern.</li>
	<li>Vandal triggered an explosion that opened a path&mdash;sending the ship hurtling through collapsing tunnels.</li>
	<li>The party was swept along with the vessel as the cave system collapsed, emerging from a mountain waterfall and crashing into the sea below.</li>
	<li>Several members were injured; Norr used Alter Self to survive underwater, and the Summoner&rsquo;s magical dolphins rescued survivors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An Unexpected Greeting</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>As they regrouped at sea, a war galleon approached flying a pirate flag.</li>
	<li>Boarding parties consisted of both pirates and paladins.</li>
	<li>They were hailed as &ldquo;new guests&rdquo; by emissaries of Captain Bianca Turiados.</li>
	<li>The name alarmed Olek&mdash;Commander Turiados was the paladin he had been seeking.</li>
	<li>The party, exhausted and half-armored, was brought aboard as &ldquo;guests&rdquo; (or captives), ending the session on a cliffhanger.</li>
</ul>
