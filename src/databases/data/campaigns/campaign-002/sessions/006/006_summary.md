<h3>II. Narrative Summary</h3>
<p><strong>An Uneasy Respite</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The party arrived at the town inn around 8 p.m., exhausted from the day&rsquo;s battle.</li>
	<li>The innkeeper was testing a new stew recipe (mushroom and exotic herbs). The aroma filled the common room.</li>
	<li>Olek blessed the stew; the meal granted temporary hit points to those who ate it.</li>
	<li>Bonnie opted for a private room to safely release her feline companion.</li>
	<li>The innkeeper, pleased with their praise, waived their room fees in gratitude for their past service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Night of Feline Mayhem</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Each party member released their magical feline companions, which needed 48 hours outside their spheres to mature.</li>
	<li>Kaedin&rsquo;s two cats consumed milk, then later escaped through the wall, hunting numerous animals (mice, pigeons, dogs, cats, and a seagull). His room was left with a massive hole leading to the street.</li>
	<li>Norr&rsquo;s cat climbed walls and ceilings during the night; she concealed the damage with makeup to avoid suspicion.</li>
	<li>Soshi&rsquo;s cat ate, then peacefully slept after she used Speak with Animals to calm it.</li>
	<li>Bonnie&rsquo;s cat was well-behaved; she handled it safely and avoided any incident.</li>
	<li>At dawn, the innkeeper&rsquo;s scream revealed that Olek&rsquo;s cat, Palo, had raided the kitchen&mdash;consuming stew, milk, and honey.</li>
	<li>Olek calmed the innkeeper and compensated her with 1 gold piece for damages.</li>
	<li>Upon inspection, the innkeeper discovered Kaedin&rsquo;s damaged room and demanded 5 silver per night until repairs were made.</li>
	<li>The group decided to return all cats to their spheres for safety.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Restocking in Town</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The party went to the market to resupply. Olek and Kaedin required new armor; others sought clothing and supplies.</li>
	<li>Posters of missing pets covered the town, indirectly caused by Kaedin&rsquo;s cats&rsquo; nocturnal hunt.</li>
	<li>Bonnie gave coins to a street urchin who, in return, gifted her clean rags; she also contacted a local thieves&rsquo; guild contact to acquire new tools.</li>
	<li>Kaedin&rsquo;s lack of a shirt caused an old man to chastise him; Bonnie used telepathy to spook the man, sending him to pray at the shrine.</li>
	<li>The party found a honey vendor selling 30+ types of honey, including exotic pink-glowing varieties recognized by Soshi as key for training magical mounts. They purchased several jars and a barrel for storage.</li>
	<li>At the general store, run by Jaret, they sold gems (uncut) for 10 gp after discovering the pearls were fakes. Bonnie&rsquo;s persuasion aided the deal.</li>
	<li>Soshi and Norr bought elegant new robes; Kaedin purchased simple clothes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Armorer&rsquo;s Forge</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The group visited a forge run by a dwarf smith and a gnome partner.</li>
	<li>Olek presented a discount note from Noro, earning a 20% discount on purchases.</li>
	<li>Kaedin bought Splint Mail; Olek bought Chain Mail.</li>
	<li>The smith examined the &ldquo;Taylas&rdquo; pelts, recognizing them as rare materials.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Offered to reinforce three armors for 1 gp each or buy the pelts for 5 gp apiece.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>The group sold two pelts and used the third for reinforcement on Olek&rsquo;s, Kaedin&rsquo;s, and Bonnie&rsquo;s armor.</li>
	<li>They paid the remaining balance and waited while the work was completed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A New Contract</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>During the wait, they reported to Captain Sorana at the barracks.</li>
	<li>Olek and Kaedin assisted in drilling her recruits, improving their formation.</li>
	<li>Bonnie used Mage Hand to play pranks, unbuckling soldiers&rsquo; belts for comic relief.</li>
	<li>The party reported their findings from the temple ruins and pirate encounter.</li>
	<li>Sorana confirmed reports of robbed ships in the harbor, linking them to the pirates.</li>
	<li>As payment for the temple mission, she awarded the party 20 gp.</li>
	<li>Sorana assigned a new task: investigate four missing barbarian riders last seen in the Witchwood, northwest of town.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Road to the Witchwood</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The party retrieved their reinforced armor (enhanced for physical and magical resistance) and departed, bringing the barrel of honey on Olek&rsquo;s spectral steed.</li>
	<li>They released their cats to travel alongside them.</li>
	<li>Hours later, they found the remains of two burned caravans&mdash;ten civilian victims (men, women, and children).</li>
	<li>Bonnie tracked the culprits: ~20 orcs on Warg-back, heading northwest toward Witchwood.</li>
	<li>The attack was recent (previous night). The group advanced cautiously.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Ruined Fortress</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The forest ahead appeared unnaturally lifeless. Orc tracks were partially concealed.</li>
	<li>They reached a clearing with a ruined fortress&mdash;the ground pulsing with lingering abjuration and renewal magic.</li>
	<li>A single large skeleton patrolled the battlements.</li>
	<li>Bonnie scouted via flight, spotting:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Stables (with voices in Goblin)</li>
		<li>A ruined tower (caved roof)</li>
		<li>Main keep (skeleton above)</li>
	</ul>
	<li>She overheard Hobgoblins playing dice inside the stable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trial by Fire</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Plan: Soshi casts Grease, followed by Norr&rsquo;s Fireball to ignite it.</li>
	<li>The explosion destroyed the stable, incinerating several Hobgoblins and triggering an all-out battle.</li>
	<li>Enemies emerging from across the fortress:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>2 Wargs (on fire)</li>
		<li>4 Hobgoblin warriors</li>
		<li>1 Manticore (from the tower)</li>
		<li>2 Warg riders</li>
		<li>1 Minotaur (from side building)</li>
		<li>1 Mud Elemental (from the courtyard)</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Olek charged forward, killing one Hobgoblin, but was seized by the Manticore and carried into the air.</li>
	<li>Soshi&rsquo;s Scorching Rays missed; Norr cast a second Fireball, severely injuring more foes.</li>
	<li>Bonnie turned invisible, assassinated the shaman, and warned the party the enemy knew they were coming.</li>
	<li>Kaedin used his Echo to flank, cutting down a Warg.</li>
	<li>The Mud Elemental attacked Adi; the Minotaur charged Soshi but missed.</li>
	<li>Norr, blinded, cast a draconic cone but missed and was grappled by the Minotaur.</li>
	<li>Olek was stung midair by the Manticore&rsquo;s poisoned tail.</li>
	<li>Bonnie freed Norr by killing her attacker; Kaedin and the others held the line.</li>
	<li>Olek escaped the Manticore&rsquo;s grasp, gliding into a battlement and killing an archer.</li>
	<li>Norr used Misty Step to escape restraint; her cats cut her bindings.</li>
	<li>Kaedin destroyed the Mud Elemental; Olek finished the remaining archer.</li>
	<li>The last shaman ordered a retreat: &ldquo;Alert the Wormlord!&rdquo;</li>
	<li>The shaman and Minotaur fled through the main gate.</li>
	<li>Combat ended with the fortress ablaze and the party victorious but exhausted.</li>
</ul>
