        After a noisy infiltration, the party discovered evidence of a massive invasion force approaching Drellin's Ferry in 4 days, completed a dangerous blood ritual that killed Kalistra and drained Norr's essence, then fought through spectral guardians and temple defenders to reach a vault containing the corrupted Null Brand artifact guarded by an aging Kalistra.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>II. Narrative Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Regrouping and Recovery</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The party regrouped after the previous battle in the fortress courtyard.</li>
	<li>Kaedin was heavily injured (5 HP remaining), prompting discussion about using remaining healing resources.</li>
	<li>Norr and Soshi reviewed their limited spell slots; the group debated whether to take a short rest.</li>
	<li>They decided against resting to avoid losing momentum and potential surprise.</li>
	<li>The group moved to a more defensible position to patch wounds and plan.</li>
	<li>Bonnie&rsquo;s familiar returned with a pack of fish &ldquo;gift,&rdquo; prompting lighthearted banter before refocusing on the mission.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scouting the Fortress</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Bonnie scouted the perimeter (Investigation 21), discovering:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The main gate heavily fortified and locked.</li>
		<li>Two other entry points: through the burned barracks (right) and a side door into an administrative building with visible guards.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>She recommended the barracks route as the least defended.</li>
	<li>Time check: roughly 6 PM, daylight fading.</li>
	<li>Kaedin used hit dice to recover to 49 HP.</li>
	<li>The group clarified familiar durations and prepared for infiltration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Noisy Infiltration</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Bonnie led the stealth approach; heavy armor made silence difficult.</li>
	<li>Kaedin&rsquo;s armor produced constant noise (&ldquo;clink-clank&rdquo;), and Soshi tore her cloak during movement.</li>
	<li>Despite decent rolls (Kaedin 15), the group was audibly detected.</li>
	<li>Bonnie advanced alone to scout interior rooms:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Found an empty throne room with torture devices and several dead merchants.</li>
		<li>Recovered a roughly sketched tactical map she couldn&rsquo;t interpret.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>As the party followed, their noise echoed through the halls&mdash;Bonnie remarked that &ldquo;the entire fortress probably heard them coming.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>The group reassembled in the main hall, weapons ready to proceed deeper.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discovery and Debate</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The party descended into lower tunnels via a sloping ramp.</li>
	<li>Bonnie searched for traps while others analyzed discovered maps and documents.</li>
	<li>Findings included:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Evidence of a large enemy force marching toward Drellin&rsquo;s Ferry, ETA &asymp; 4 days.</li>
		<li>Estimated enemy strength &asymp; 19 &times; greater than previous engagements.</li>
		<li>A single bridge en route&mdash;potential choke point to delay the invasion 2&ndash;3 days if destroyed.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Debate followed:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Some argued to warn or save the village; others felt the townsfolk had ignored prior warnings and should face consequences.</li>
		<li>Messaging options via familiars were dismissed due to range limits.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Bonnie identified signs of a red dragon&rsquo;s involvement (magical residue and claw marks), confirming dragon activity tied to the invasion.</li>
	<li>The discovery heightened urgency and internal disagreement on next steps.</li>
	<li>Two paths revealed ahead:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Left: bloody tracks, whispers, scent of the aerial creature, and fresh air.</li>
		<li>Right: quieter, descending deeper into the structure.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Norr and Soshi sensed strong arcane energies from the left passage.</li>
	<li>The group opted to investigate cautiously.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Ritual Chamber</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Jack the familiar was sent ahead to scout while the group explored the right corridor.</li>
	<li>They reached a circular stone chamber with:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Faded runes, blood-stained ritual circle, and scattered corpses (mercenaries and rogues).</li>
		<li>Signs of a suspended blood-binding ritual designed to open a sealed stone door.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Among the dead was Kalistra, the group&rsquo;s former mentor, confirming her death during the ritual.</li>
	<li>Bonnie&rsquo;s Thieves&rsquo; Cant revealed markings linking both the Arcane Seekers and the Brotherhood to this operation.</li>
	<li>Heated discussion followed:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Some party members had hidden knowledge of a map leading here.</li>
		<li>Accusations of deception and withheld motives surfaced.</li>
		<li>The group concluded the sealed chamber likely held something powerful and dangerous.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Blood Magic and Spectral Guardians</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The party decided to complete the ritual to open the sealed door.</li>
	<li>One member performed the blood draw (Constitution save), another channeled energy (Charisma check).</li>
	<li>As the ritual activated, the corpses animated&mdash;spectral guardians rose to attack.</li>
	<li>Combat highlights:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Ghostly attacks drained memories instead of only HP.</li>
		<li>Soshi and others lost fragments of traumatic memories.</li>
		<li>Olek&rsquo;s divine powers temporarily failed, severing his holy connection.</li>
		<li>The wolf familiar was nearly drawn into the ritual&rsquo;s energy.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Tactical coordination and damage mitigation became critical; the group balanced survival with maintaining the ritual.</li>
	<li>Soshi debated using excess power from the bound souls; Olek questioned the morality of that act, reinforcing her &ldquo;good&rdquo; alignment.</li>
	<li>Norr maintained focus under extreme pressure, channeling energy while allies fended off ghosts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Door Shatters</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Norr&rsquo;s ritual beam intensified into a green-electric arc toward the sealed door.</li>
	<li>All her spell slots refreshed, but HP dropped to 33.</li>
	<li>Massive combined attacks followed:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Bonnie landed critical dagger strikes (34 damage).</li>
		<li>Kaedin delivered a critical blow with 13 damage, then used a potion (14 healing).</li>
		<li>Soshi&rsquo;s Scorching Ray added consistent ranged damage.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>The ghosts concentrated attacks on Norr, dealing 34 damage and dropping her to 0 HP.</li>
	<li>The ritual&rsquo;s magic sustained her body, allowing Olek to stabilize her with a potion.</li>
	<li>Norr&rsquo;s spirit briefly separated, then was pulled back into her body.</li>
	<li>With a final 23 Charisma check, Norr completed the ritual&mdash;the door shattered, the beam dissipated, and the ghosts&rsquo; link was broken.</li>
	<li>Consequences:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Norr &ndash; Intelligence &ndash;2.</li>
		<li>Gained +2 3rd-level and +2 2nd-level spell slots permanently.</li>
		<li>Alignment shifted to Neutral.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Temple Battle</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The newly opened chamber triggered a massive fight inside the corrupted temple.</li>
	<li>Enemy casters and warriors surrounded the party.</li>
	<li>Kaedin&rsquo;s Green-Flame Blade chain-hit multiple targets (24 damage + 11 follow-up).</li>
	<li>An enemy wall of fire dropped Norr again (19 fire damage).</li>
	<li>Kaedin landed another critical hit (20 damage) during an opportunity attack, saving Norr from being executed.</li>
	<li>The support caster (Soshi) used a modified Aganazar&rsquo;s Scorcher as a healing conduit, restoring:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>22 HP to Norr.</li>
		<li>Additional healing to Kaedin and Olek.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Norr retaliated with Dragon&rsquo;s Breath &ndash; Lightning (Dex DC 18 failures; 22 damage, two enemies killed).</li>
	<li>Olek landed a critical smite (34 damage), finishing the final caster.</li>
	<li>The party stood victorious but exhausted; multiple members had fallen unconscious during the fight.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Vault and the Null Brand</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Investigation 27 revealed key artifacts and items:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Patch of strange mushrooms.</li>
		<li>Bone flute.</li>
		<li>Book titled <em>The Deama Sutrel.</em><em><br /></em></li>
		<li>Strength Belt (STR 18) and Amulet of Absorption.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Loot distributed after debate on item suitability.</li>
	<li>Proceeding deeper, they discovered the final vault&mdash;a blackstone chamber radiating corruption.</li>
	<li>At its center: a black iron brand shaped like a broken star, glowing with red runes&mdash;the Null Brand.</li>
	<li>Kalistra, still alive but aged and corrupted, was bound to it by arcane chains, using her life to contain the artifact&rsquo;s energy.</li>
	<li>Bonnie approached unseen (Stealth Nat 20), recovered magical boots, and assessed the scene.</li>
	<li>Tense dialogue with Kalistra followed; she requested aid to stabilize the Brand, hinting at plans to later claim it for the Brotherhood.</li>
	<li>The group planned contingencies to restrain or neutralize her after the ritual (Hold Person, Counterspell, Grapple).</li>
	<li>Before they could act, a red dragonkin and 20 orcs arrived outside the vault.</li>
	<li>The dragon&rsquo;s command echoed through the chamber:&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve breached the chamber for us! Go in and take the artifact!&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Session ended with the party trapped between Kalistra and the incoming dragon-led force.</li>
</ul>
